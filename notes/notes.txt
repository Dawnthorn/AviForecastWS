    existing avi center integrations
        NWAC integration: switch to NWAC JSON api (if they can support pull); or revamp HTML parsing for new format (look at dev.nwac.us)
        UAC integration: RSS feeds being reworked, feeds should be back mid-Nov or sooner; also check on availability of "tomorrow" forecasts
    support other avi centers
        send integration email to not-yet-integrated avalanche organizations (ask about API -- strongly prefer consistently structured data!!!)
        provide a spec, or even an implementation, of a simple forecast publishing web service to the avalanche centers? or RSS format?
        CA
            Sierra (SAC) -- talked with Andy Anderson; he will send KML; suggests parsing RSS for data; moving to CAAML eventually
            Eastern Sierra (ESAC) -- received KMZ; pinged Nate Greenberg regarding new data format
            Mount Shasta -- want to integrate, but tech guy is swamped (as of 2012-10-15); circle back in a while

            WhistlerBlackcomb -- http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/weather/advisory/index.htm (sent email for integration); NOTE this region is a subset of sea-to-sky!; but looks like they do their own forecast
            CAC Yukon -- emailed CAC for region definition
            Haute Gaspesie -- emailed CAC for region definition; http://www.centreavalanche.qc.ca/bulletins/bulletin_en.php

        validate by time of day (e.g. forecast should be issued by 8am or whatever)
        have classes of validation (issued daily vs. irregularly, issued day before vs. morning of, etc.)
        on error, capture all inputs, and alert me
        also snapshot user URL vs. data URL vs. my forecast always, for later review
        add automatic, ongoing checks of HTML vs. CAAML results for all api-based sites?
Android
    create Android v1
        UI
            lay out basic views

            nwac mobile site hack
        danger scale view
        offline caching
            WebView has an answer, but not sure about offline for maps, or for direct data calls
        other
            legal disclaimer (and settings storage)
            flurry
            production map key
            appirater equivalent?
iOS
    v1.2
        map zoom level is different on iPhone 5 ... why? bug filed with apple (https://bugreport.apple.com/)
        waiting for app review
    v2
        sharing
            make it easy to share (virally) via facebook, twitter
        info section
            change info button to bring up a table of topics (master/detail), not a pop-up
            add link to webpage that shows all partners, etc.
            add more usage info, in terms of what "no rating" means, using your brain out there, etc.
            add info on human factors and decision making -- find good reference
        status bar
            add status bar with current operation (loading regions, reloading forecasts, forecast last updated xxx ago, read from offline cache, etc.)?
                need to think through how to handle multiple messages, no messages, etc.
            add alert/feedback if there are no avalanche forecast regions near your current position
            add more prominent loading spinner for when loading regions/forecasts
            add forecasts last fetched time (need to pull from cache or persist, for offline case) (System Font size 13; label height 18)?
        offline mode improvements
            offline: give message if detailed view unavailable for a region?
            really stale detailed forecast content can stay in persistent cache... address by not showing content if forecasts for that region is already out of date?
            say when data was cached, for every page?
    v3
        add system message capability, to send dynamic messages to users (e.g. problem with forecast center X; forecast center Y added; etc.)
        more data at-a-glance
            show the danger rose as an icon on the map too within each region?
            click on a region to bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
            label regions with their names? give them a danger level icon?
        cache regions.json persistently in app, for performance? (as file is large, and growing) -- probably not needed after digit compression
            do a lightweight validity check to see if file update is necessary (still important to keep dynamic region file updates, e.g. if URL changes)
            note that every time i push to heroku, the file timestamp is updated, so ETag or hash might be better than if-modified-since
            see for ideas: http://iphoneincubator.com/blog/server-communication/how-to-download-a-file-only-if-it-has-been-updated
            store where it cannot be erased by iOS (separate from other cache)
            could implement as a customer NSURLProtocolHandler, in front of the other one
            load new file before proceeding
            make sure i handle both the offline and online cases
            preload cache at app install
            get rid of special no regions.json alert path, if no longer needed
            OR... use a software update style model instead? (never block user waiting for download...
                although investigate what happens to network ops if the app loses focus
            reload regions.json periodically in app (for case where people don't restart the app/phone regularly)
        feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
        add a "help your avalanche center" feature to take you to donation pages?
        add more avi reference info?
        add weather info?
        add telemetry info?
        show previous days, for history? allow selecting further into the future?
        add push notifications?
        get app rotation working in all views (or at least danger scale definition view)?
        make iPad experience better?


avalanche forecast center intro/integration blurb:
--------------------
[Avalanche Forecasts mobile app integration]

Hello,

Earlier this year I developed a free iPhone app that displays avalanche conditions "at-a-glance", across multiple forecasting centers. My goal is to make avalanche forecasts more readily accessible to folks heading out into the backcountry. Bottom-line danger levels are shown color-coded for each forecast region on a map (following the standard North American danger scale), based on the selected timeframe (Today/Tomorrow/2 Days Out). Clicking on any region brings up the detailed avalanche forecast from the source forecasting center. All content is cached for offline use, so you can refer back to the information you've seen even if you lose coverage in the mountains.

You can read more about the application, see screenshots, read reviews, and download it here:
http://itunes.apple.com/app/avalanche-forecasts/id501231389?mt=8

I currently have it working with the NWAC (Northwest US), CAIC (Colorado), UAC (Utah), CAC (Canada), VIAC (Vancouver Island), and Parks Canada forecasting centers (50 forecast regions total so far). My goals over time are to eventually include all the avalanche forecasting centers across North America, as well as to bring this to other mobile platforms beyond iOS (with Android being next on that list).

In preperation for the coming snow season, I'd like to get your forecast center integrated. Would you please connect me with your technical point of contact?

In order to integrate technically, there are two elements i'll need:
1) forecast region definitions: do you happen to have a KMZ file (or any similar geographic data file) that describes the borders of each of your forecast regions in terms of latitude/longitude coordinate paths? If not, i can work with you to create this.
2) forecast data: do you have a CAAML feed or other API that i can use to pull forecast information? Alternatively I can extract the forecast information by parsing your web pages, but a structured data feed is the much more robust approach.

Thanks for your help!

Seth

ps: A word on my motivations: i'm doing this project as a free service to the outdoors community, because i feel getting the avalanche forecast information out there broadly, consistently, and in an easy-to-consume fashion is so important. Many of us (myself included) have lost friends to avalanches. Anything we can do to get the information out there, so that people are armed to make good decisions, feels important and valuable. Plus its a fun project!

pps: if you'd like to chat, my cell is 206-553-9420.

I'd like to spread the word more broadly about this app within the avalanche/backcountry community. If you can help via an email out to the AIARE instructors, that would be fantastic. Also, any additional introductions you can help with, such as with the AAA and the National Avalanche Center, would be great.

Thanks for your help!
