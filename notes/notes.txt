things to do for launch:
--------------------
marketing
    determine pricing!!!
    flesh out sebnarware.com/icicleventures.com website (marketing page, support page; any email addresses needed)
    app store optimization (http://www.mobiledevhq.com/ -- help with keywords, etc. -- once app is in app store)
    post on my facebook
    ping all my beta testers
    email bushwackers, wac
    reach out to avalanche centers
    get screenshots for details screens that match overview screens
v1.01
    beta test
    submit to Apple

things to do later:
--------------------
business
    set up bank-to-bank transfer between SmithBarney and USBank
    transfer money into account
    switch brinkster hosting (and other biz expenses) to biz account, once i have the new debit card
    order checks for biz account?
    figure out better solution for sebnarware.com/icicleventures.com emails
        (brinkster aliases and forwarding didn't work to gmail, would get a delivery failure; although it would forward fine to hotmail)
        (current approach: have brinkster email accounts for each, and have gmail poll them via POP3 into my seth@pollackphoto.com account)
        (drawbacks of current approach: mail may not be polled frequently; limit of 5 accounts)
        (other issues: can do from field fine in gmail web client, but not in Apple Mail or iPhone mail)
        possible solution: keep separate accounts, but add each in my mail clients?
WS
    clean up deprecated request handling stuff in webservice (or leave for testing purposes)?
    clean up timestamps in webservice -- heroku adds its own, probably don't need mine
    webservice testing
        build more unit tests
        add examples of real pages from the sites as well as other corner cases, to ensure accuracy
    support other avi centers (contact them as i go)
        pc.gc.ca (4 regions) [CAAML at http://avalanche.pc.gc.ca/CAAML-eng.aspx?d=TODAY&r=1 etc.]
        Canada independents (WhistlerBlackcomb, Vancouver Island, Kananaskis)
        Utah
        Colorado
        other US (look at avalanche.org for details)
    switch to NWAC JSON api when available
    update linked components?
    staging environment?
    server-based trending?
    better monitoring (e.g. pingdom $10/mo; StillAlive $7/mo)?
iOS
    remove hack and use mobile version of NWAC site (and other sites)?
    get rotation and zooming working correctly on danger level view
    more data at-a-glance
        click on a region bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
        some suggested putting some sort of icon (ie, danger level symbol) on the forecast zone would encourage one to tap it
    have version numbers for disclaimer accepted (use app version number)?
    feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
    deal w/ folks not allowing location services in some way (help text? FAQ on website?)
    look into Safari Reader mode -- can this be leaveraged programmatically for the details web pages?
    label regions with their names?
    data management
        make sure regions.json is cached persistently in the common case, and do an if-modified-since or equiv to update, for performance (file is large, and growing) (and get rid of special no regions.json alert path if so)
        use cache contents even if network is available (either per regular cache rules; or as first data, before network data loads)?
        divide persistent cache into two, a) must keep and b) want to keep but purgable by iOS5 (see http://robnapier.net/blog/offline-uiwebview-nsurlprotocol-588)?
        really stale detailed forecast content can stay in persistent cache... address by not showing content if forecasts for that region is already out of date?
        refresh regions.json periodically (requires full cleanup and reload)?
        offline: give message if detailed view unavailable for a region?
    ask for app ratings within the app?
    viral aspect -- make it easy to share via FB/twitter?
    add forecasts last fetched time (need to pull from cache or persist, for offline case)(System Font size 13; label height 18)? add refresh button for explicit refresh forecast?
    add weather info?
    add telemetry info?
    add more avi reference info?
    show previous days, for history?
    add push notifications?
    update linked components?
    mapkit crash bug -- implement workaround of drawing everything with one annotion? (seen this in the simulator, but never yet on a real device)
