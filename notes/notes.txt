things to do for launch:
--------------------
pre-launch
    determine pricing (and what to say, if anything, in app blurb)!!!
    flesh out sebnarware.com/icicleventures.com website (marketing page, support page; any email addresses needed)
    get screenshots for details screens that match overview screens in terms of danger levels, if possible
post-launch
    app store optimization (http://www.mobiledevhq.com/ -- help with keywords, etc. -- once app is in app store)
    post on my facebook
    ping all my beta testers
    email bushwackers, wac
    reach out to avalanche centers
v1.1
    beta test
    submit to Apple

things to do later:
--------------------
business
    set up bank-to-bank transfer between SmithBarney and USBank, via Mike Napier
    transfer money into account
    switch brinkster hosting (and other biz expenses) to biz account
    figure out better solution for sebnarware.com/icicleventures.com emails
        (brinkster aliases and forwarding didn't work to gmail, would get a delivery failure; although it would forward fine to hotmail)
        (current approach: have brinkster email accounts for each, and have gmail poll them via POP3 into my seth@pollackphoto.com account)
        (drawbacks of current approach: mail may not be polled frequently; limit of 5 accounts)
        (other issues: can do from field fine in gmail web client, but not in Apple Mail or iPhone mail)
        possible solution: keep separate accounts, but add each in my mail clients?
WS
    data bug from Parks Canada: affects regions 1 and 2 (Banff/Yoho/Kootenay; Jasper)
    support other avi centers (contact them as i go)
        Colorado (10 regions) -- sent email
        Utah (7 regions) -- sent email
        Bridger-Teton (3 regions)
        Gallatin (3 regions)
        other US (look at avalanche.org for list)
        Crested Butte: http://www.cbavalanchecenter.org/
        WhistlerBlackcomb: http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/weather/advisory/index.htm
        Vancouver Island: http://www.islandavalanchebulletin.com/
        Haute Gaspesie: (French; don't have region info) http://www.centreavalanche.qc.ca/bulletins/
        Other CAC that are not currently full forecasts (North Rockies, Bighorn, Yukon)
    add more forecast data test cases
    switch to NWAC JSON api when available and stable
    update linked components?
    server-based trending?
    better monitoring (e.g. pingdom $10/mo; StillAlive $7/mo)?
iOS
    ask for app ratings within the app?
    viral aspect -- make it easy to share via FB/twitter?
    get rotation and zooming working correctly on danger level view
    add forecasts last fetched time (need to pull from cache or persist, for offline case)(System Font size 13; label height 18)? add refresh button for explicit refresh forecast?
    add status bar with current operation (loading regions, reloading forecasts, forecast last updated xxx ago, read from offline cache, etc.)?
    switch to DLOG macro so logging ins't in released build?
    cache regions.json persistently in app, for performance? (as file is large, and growing)
        do a lightweight validity check to see if file update is necessary (still important to keep dynamic region file updates, e.g. if URL changes)
        note that every time i push to heroku, the file timestamp is updated, so ETag or hash might be better than if-modified-since
        see for ideas: http://iphoneincubator.com/blog/server-communication/how-to-download-a-file-only-if-it-has-been-updated
        store where it cannot be erased by iOS (separate from other cache)
        could implement as a customer NSURLProtocolHandler, in front of the other one
        load new file before proceeding
        make sure i handle both the offline and online cases
        preload cache at app install
        get rid of special no regions.json alert path, if no longer needed
    offline mode
        offline: give message if detailed view unavailable for a region?
        really stale detailed forecast content can stay in persistent cache... address by not showing content if forecasts for that region is already out of date?
    label regions with their names?
    more data at-a-glance
        click on a region bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
        some suggested putting some sort of icon (ie, danger level symbol) on the forecast zone would encourage one to tap it
    feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
    deal w/ folks not allowing location services in some way (help text? FAQ on website?)
    add weather info?
    add telemetry info?
    add more avi reference info?
    show previous days, for history? allow selecting further into the future?
    add push notifications?
    update linked components?
    have version numbers for disclaimer accepted (use app version number)?
additional versions to consider
    Pro (ie paid; one time or subscription) iPhone version
    Android version
    PhoneGap version for other platforms (WinPhone, Blackberry, etc.)

avalanche forecast center intro blurb:
--------------------
Hello,

I'm currently developing an iPhone app that displays avalanche conditions "at-a-glance", across multiple forecast regions/centers. My goal is to make avalanche forecasts more readily accessible to folks heading out into the backcountry. Bottom-line danger levels are shown color-coded for each forecast region on a map, based on the selected timeframe (Today/Tomorrow/2 Days Out). Clicking on any region brings up the detailed avalanche forecast from the source forecasting center. All content is cached for offline use, so you can refer back to the information you've seen even if you lose coverage in the mountains.

I currently have it working with the NWAC, CAC, and Parks Canada forecasting centers (30 regions total). Integrating with you all is next on my list. I'd like to eventually include all the avalanche forecasting centers across North America.

I wanted to touch base with you for several reasons.

First, I want to see about the best way to integrate technically. I can certainly parse the HTML (i.e. from the region-specific bulletin web pages) to gather the forecasts, but if you have something designed for programmatic access, such as a JSON or XML API, please let me know. Also, do you happen to have a KML/KMZ file or anything similar (i.e. geographic data) that describes the borders of your forecast subregions in terms of latitude/longitude coordinate paths? This would be a great help towards integration.

Second, if anyone there has an iPhone (or iPod Touch, or iPad) running iOS4.2+, and would be interested in beta testing the app, i'd be glad to have your input.

Third, i want to get the word out about this application within the avalanche community. I hope to launch it in the Apple app store in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks for your input and help.

Seth Pollack
