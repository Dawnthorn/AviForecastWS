things to do:
----------
 business
    change my developer account with Apple from individual to business (in progress)
    set up icicleventures.com/sebnarware.com website (marketing page, support page)
    set up bank-to-bank transfer between SmithBarney and USBank [via Mike Napier; also: update will; Anna's account access; paper stmt]
    take screenshots, and trim off status bars (should be 640x920, down from 640x960)
    write app marketing blurb
    submit app to Apple via iTunes Connect
    marketing effort
        app store optimization (http://www.mobiledevhq.com/ -- help with keywords, etc. -- once app is in app store)
        post on my facebook
        ping all my beta testers
        email bushwackers, wac
        reach out to avalanche centers
business, later
    switch brinkster hosting (and other biz expenses) to biz account, once i have the new debit card
    order checks for biz account?
    figure out better solution for icicleventures.com/sebnarware.com emails
        (brinkster aliases and forwarding didn't work to gmail, would get a delivery failure; although it would forward fine to hotmail)
        (current approach: have brinkster email accounts for each, and have gmail poll them via POP3 into my seth@pollackphoto.com account)
        (drawbacks of current approach: mail may not be polled frequently; limit of 5 accounts)
        (other issues: can do from field fine in gmail web client, but not in Apple Mail or iPhone mail)
        possible solution: keep separate accounts, but add each in my mail clients?
iOS
    feedback: make "tap region" message a hint that slides out after some time period? or replace with help/info button and page?
    legend
        feedback: link from legend to info page (or have it slide down or pop up), or definitions one by one (feedback from Kenny)
        is it readable enough? looked just readable on iPhone 3G (consider taller&narrower font; hyphenated words)
    data management
        test with poor (but present) network connection
        performance is slow on older phones -- review flurry data after we've had a few days to gather it
        make sure regions.json is cached persistently in the common case, and do an if-modified-since or equiv to update
        add forecasts last fetched time?
        add refresh button for explicit forecast refresh?
        refresh regions.json periodically (requires full cleanup and reload...)?
        persistent cache
            really stale detailed forecast content can stay in cache... address by not showing content if forecasts for that region is already out of date?
            divide into two persistent caches, must keep and want to keep but purgable by iOS5 (see http://robnapier.net/blog/offline-uiwebview-nsurlprotocol-588)?
            limit size of purgable cache? probably not needed
            use cache contents even if network is available (either per regular cache rules; or as first data, before network data loads)?
    add "3 days out", for CAC? rename "today", [tue], [wed], [thu] or similar? but this makes NWAC look bad...
    more data at-a-glance
        click on a region bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
        some suggested putting some sort of icon (ie, danger level symbol) on the forecast zone would encourage one to tap it
    add an info page that gives instructions?
    liability warning?
    ask for app ratings?
    viral aspect -- make it easy to share via FB/twitter?
    mapkit crash bug -- implement workaround? (seen this in the simulator, but never yet on a real device)

WS
    testing
        build more unit tests
        add examples of real pages from the sites as well as other corner cases, to ensure accuracy
    support other avi centers (contact them as i go)
        pc.gc.ca (4 regions)
        Canada independents (WhistlerBlackcomb, Vancouver Island, Kananaskis)
        Utah
        Colorado
        other US (look at avalanche.org for details)
future possibilities
    switch to NWAC JSON api when available
    feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
    weather info
    telemetry info
    more avi reference info
    show previous days, for history
    push notifications
    consider updating shared components (client; server)
    Pro version of app
    Android version
    WinPhone version
    PhoneGap version
    iPad-specific version
    staging env
    better monitoring (e.g. pingdom $10/mo; StillAlive $7/mo)
