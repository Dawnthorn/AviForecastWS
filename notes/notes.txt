        other
            drop custom user agent string (assuming we can make NWAC work ok; validate with all sites)
            CAIC urls should be https at the top level, but this breaks iOS offline caching -- figure out why and fix

            review set of events overall
    v2
        status bar (or pop-ups of some sort?)
            add status bar with current operation (loading regions, reloading forecasts, forecast last updated xxx ago, read from offline cache, etc.)?
                need to think through how to handle multiple messages, no messages, etc.
            add alert/feedback if there are no avalanche forecast regions near your current position
            add forecasts last fetched time (need to pull from cache or persist, for offline case) (System Font size 13; label height 18)?
        offline mode improvements
            say when cached data is being used
            offline: give message if detailed view unavailable for a region
            really stale detailed forecast content can stay in persistent cache... 
                address by not showing content if forecasts for that region is already out of date?
                flag the detailed forecast page if the forecast is a day or more out of date? (from discussion from Bruce T)
            say when data was cached, for every page?
    v3
        add system message capability, to send dynamic messages to users (e.g. problem with forecast center X; forecast center Y added; etc.)
        more data at-a-glance
            show the danger stack (elevation view) as an icon or popup on the map too within each region?
            click on a region to bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
            label regions with their names? give them a danger level icon?
        cache regions.json persistently in app, for performance? (as file is large, and growing) -- probably not needed after digit compression
            do a lightweight validity check to see if file update is necessary (still important to keep dynamic region file updates, e.g. if URL changes)
            note that every time i push to heroku, the file timestamp is updated, so ETag or hash might be better than if-modified-since
            see for ideas: http://iphoneincubator.com/blog/server-communication/how-to-download-a-file-only-if-it-has-been-updated
            store where it cannot be erased by iOS (separate from other cache)
            could implement as a customer NSURLProtocolHandler, in front of the other one
            load new file before proceeding
            make sure i handle both the offline and online cases
            preload cache at app install
            get rid of special no regions.json alert path, if no longer needed
            OR... use a software update style model instead? (never block user waiting for download...
                although investigate what happens to network ops if the app loses focus
            reload regions.json periodically in app (for case where people don't restart the app/phone regularly)
        make iPad experience better (user request)
        full height launch screen for iPhone5 (no black bars)
        feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
        add a "help your avalanche center" feature to take you to donation pages?
        add more avi reference info?
        add weather info?
        add telemetry info?
        show previous days, for history? allow selecting further into the future?
        add push notifications?
        get app rotation working in all views (or at least danger scale definition view)?

avalanche forecast center intro/integration blurb:
--------------------
[Avalanche Forecasts mobile app integration]

Hello,

I recently developed a free avalanche forecasts mobile app, and I'd like to get your forecast center integrated.

The app, which is available for both iPhone and Android, displays avalanche conditions "at-a-glance", across multiple forecasting centers. My goal is to make avalanche forecasts more readily accessible to folks heading out into the backcountry. Bottom-line danger levels are shown color-coded for each forecast region on a map (following the standard North American danger scale), based on the selected timeframe (Today/Tomorrow/2 Days Out). Clicking on any region brings up the detailed avalanche forecast from the source forecasting center. All content is cached for offline use, so you can refer back to the information you've seen even if you lose coverage in the mountains.

I currently have it integrated with the NWAC, CAIC, UAC, BTAC, GNFAC, SAC, CAC, VIAC, and Parks Canada forecasting centers. I'd like to eventually include all the avalanche forecasting centers across North America.

You can view screenshots, etc. and download the app here: http://avalancheforecasts.com/

In order to integrate technically, there are two elements i'll need. Usually this is a very small amount of work for you. 
1) forecast region definitions: do you happen to have a KMZ file (or any similar geographic data file) that describes the borders of each of your forecast regions in terms of latitude/longitude coordinate paths? If not, i can work with you to create this.
2) forecast data: do you have a CAAML feed or other data API that i can use to pull forecast information? Alternatively I can extract the forecast information by parsing your web pages, but a structured data feed is the much more robust approach.
Would you please connect me with your technical point of contact? 

Thanks for your help!

ps: A word on my motivations: i'm doing this project as a pro bono service to the outdoors community, because i feel getting the avalanche forecast information out there broadly, consistently, and in an easy-to-consume fashion is so important. Plus its a fun project!

[Avalanche Forecasts mobile app]

I recently developed a free avalanche forecasts mobile app, and I'd like to spread the word more broadly about this app within the community. If you can help by XXX, that would be great.

My goal is to make avalanche forecasts more readily accessible to folks heading out into the backcountry.

Clicking on any region brings up the detailed avalanche forecast from the source forecasting center. All content is cached for offline use, so you can refer back to the information you've seen even if you lose coverage in the mountains.

I currently have integrated with the NWAC (Northwest US), CAIC (Colorado), UAC (Utah), BTAC (Jackson Hole), GNFAC (Bozeman), SAC (central Sierras), CAC (Canada), VIAC (Vancouver Island), and Parks Canada forecasting centers (over 60 forecast regions total). My goals over time are to eventually include all the avalanche forecasting centers across North America.
