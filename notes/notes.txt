things to do now:
--------------------
UAC integration
    figure out URL(s) to use
    write unit tests
    write code
    test from iOS
    get UAC folks to test
    push out
    notify beta testers
    update copy in both versions of app in iTunesConnect
marketing
    make a list of avi centers with attributes (POC, last contact, # regions, etc. etc.)
    update email for avi center integration
    send to not-yet-integrated avalanche organizations
    update marketing email
    send to avalanche class instructors
    find groups in other areas (BC, Canadian Rockies, Colorado, etc.) to send info to
v1.1
    NWAC mobile vs. full issue from Kenny -- waiting for resonse from Kenny
        switch regions.json
        push to beta testers
        adjust screenshots based on outcome (either way)

things to do later:
--------------------
marketing
    get folks to write reviews, and to mark reviews as helpful
    flesh out sebnarware.com website with more app info
    get app reviewed on app review sites
    send to AAJ, Rock&Ice, Climbing, Alpinist, ski mags, etc. for review
business
    set up bank-to-bank transfer between SmithBarney and USBank (fill out forms)
    transfer money into account
    switch brinkster hosting (and other biz expenses) to biz account
WS
    support other avi centers (contact them as i go)
        Utah (7 regions) -- got regions data, need to review
        Chugach (CNFAIC) -- messaging with a person there, he wants to get integrated
        Other CAC that are not currently full forecasts (North Rockies, Bighorn, Yukon) -- show as no data regions, so users can still click through?
        WhistlerBlackcomb: http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/weather/advisory/index.htm
        Vancouver Island: http://www.islandavalanchebulletin.com/
        Haute Gaspesie: (French; don't have region info) http://www.centreavalanche.qc.ca/bulletins/
        Bridger-Teton (3 regions)
        Gallatin (3 regions)
        other US (look at avalanche.org for list)
        Crested Butte (CBAC): http://www.cbavalanchecenter.org/ -- NOTE this is within the CAIC Gunnison zone; based on email with CAIC, skip it for now
    look at libraries for parsing HTML (look at emails from Shep, Doc)
    switch to NWAC JSON api when available and stable
    add more NWAC forecast data test cases
    any way to launch unit tests from WebStorm? (opened ticket with JetBrains)
    consider putting dataURL as a field in regions.json file, and getting it that way on server, along with other regionDetails properties?
    update linked components?
    not getting heroku log messages in loggly (could switch to heroku loggly add-on for this, but lower data limit and retention time, or paid)?
    in fall 2012, contact all avi centers again to see if there have been any changes, etc.
iOS
    more data at-a-glance
        show the danger rose as an icon on the map too within each region?
        click on a region to bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
        label regions with their names? give them a danger level icon?
    viral aspect -- make it easy to share via facebook, twitter?
    get rotation and zooming working correctly on danger level view
    add forecasts last fetched time (need to pull from cache or persist, for offline case)(System Font size 13; label height 18)? add refresh button for explicit refresh forecast?
    add status bar with current operation (loading regions, reloading forecasts, forecast last updated xxx ago, read from offline cache, etc.)?
    offline mode
        offline: give message if detailed view unavailable for a region?
        really stale detailed forecast content can stay in persistent cache... address by not showing content if forecasts for that region is already out of date?
        say when data was cached, for every page?
    cache regions.json persistently in app, for performance? (as file is large, and growing) -- probably not needed after digit compression
        do a lightweight validity check to see if file update is necessary (still important to keep dynamic region file updates, e.g. if URL changes)
        note that every time i push to heroku, the file timestamp is updated, so ETag or hash might be better than if-modified-since
        see for ideas: http://iphoneincubator.com/blog/server-communication/how-to-download-a-file-only-if-it-has-been-updated
        store where it cannot be erased by iOS (separate from other cache)
        could implement as a customer NSURLProtocolHandler, in front of the other one
        load new file before proceeding
        make sure i handle both the offline and online cases
        preload cache at app install
        get rid of special no regions.json alert path, if no longer needed
        OR... use a software update style model instead? (never block user waiting for download...
            although investigate what happens to network ops if the app loses focus
    feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
    deal w/ folks not allowing location services in some way (help text? FAQ on website?)
    add weather info?
    add telemetry info?
    add more avi reference info?
    show previous days, for history? allow selecting further into the future?
    add push notifications?
    update linked components?
    have version numbers for disclaimer accepted (use app version number)?
    make iPad experience better?
additional versions to consider
    Pro (ie paid; one time or subscription) iPhone version
    go beyond North America
    Android version
    WinPhone version

avalanche forecast center intro blurb:
--------------------
Hello,

I've recently developed a free iPhone app that displays avalanche conditions "at-a-glance", across multiple forecast regions/centers. My goal is to make avalanche forecasts more readily accessible to folks heading out into the backcountry. Bottom-line danger levels are shown color-coded for each forecast region on a map, based on the selected timeframe (Today/Tomorrow/2 Days Out). Clicking on any region brings up the detailed avalanche forecast from the source forecasting center. All content is cached for offline use, so you can refer back to the information you've seen even if you lose coverage in the mountains.

You can see the application, read reviews, and download it here: http://itunes.apple.com/app/avalanche-forecasts/id501231389?mt=8

I currently have it working with the NWAC, CAIC, CAC, and Parks Canada forecasting centers (40 regions total). I'd like to get your forecast center integrated as well. My goal is to eventually include all the avalanche forecasting centers across North America.

In order to integrate technically, there are two pieces:
1) forecast region definitions:
2) actual forecast data: for some forecasting centers i parse
. I can certainly parse the HTML (i.e. from the region-specific bulletin web pages) to gather the forecasts, but if you have something designed for programmatic access, such as a JSON or XML API, please let me know.
Also, do you happen to have a KML/KMZ file or anything similar (i.e. geographic data) that describes the borders of your forecast subregions in terms of latitude/longitude coordinate paths? This would be a great help towards integration.

Thanks for your input and help.
