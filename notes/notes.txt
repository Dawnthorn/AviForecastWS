            CAC Yukon -- emailed CAC for region definition

        Crested Butte (CBAC): http://www.cbavalanchecenter.org/ -- NOTE this is within the CAIC Gunnison zone; based on email with CAIC, skip it for now
    create server-oriented regions config file (for dataURL, parser, validation exceptions, etc.), to pull cases out of code
    look at libraries for parsing HTML (node-htmlparser, plus Shep's wrapper on top; other open source wrappers seem to be CSS selection only...)
    further auto-validation of each generated forecast
        on error, capture all inputs, and alert me
        also snapshot user URL vs. data URL vs. my forecast always, for later review
        add automatic, ongoing checks of HTML vs. CAAML results for all api-based sites?
    any way to launch unit tests from WebStorm? (opened ticket with JetBrains)
    update linked components?
    not getting heroku log messages in loggly (could switch to heroku loggly add-on for this, but lower data limit and retention time, or paid)?
    in fall 2012, contact all avi centers again to see if there have been any changes, etc.
iOS
    info
        add more usage info, in terms of what "no rating" means, using your brain out there, etc.
    add alert/feedback if there are no avalanche forecast regions near your current position
    add more prominent loading spinner for when loading regions/forecasts
    viral aspect -- make it easy to share via facebook, twitter?
    add status bar with current operation (loading regions, reloading forecasts, forecast last updated xxx ago, read from offline cache, etc.)?
    add system message capability, to send dynamic messages to users
    more data at-a-glance
        show the danger rose as an icon on the map too within each region?
        click on a region to bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
        label regions with their names? give them a danger level icon?
    add forecasts last fetched time (need to pull from cache or persist, for offline case)(System Font size 13; label height 18)?
    add refresh button for explicit refresh forecast? have it do a full reload of the regions too?
    offline mode
        offline: give message if detailed view unavailable for a region?
        really stale detailed forecast content can stay in persistent cache... address by not showing content if forecasts for that region is already out of date?
        say when data was cached, for every page?
    cache regions.json persistently in app, for performance? (as file is large, and growing) -- probably not needed after digit compression
        do a lightweight validity check to see if file update is necessary (still important to keep dynamic region file updates, e.g. if URL changes)
        note that every time i push to heroku, the file timestamp is updated, so ETag or hash might be better than if-modified-since
        see for ideas: http://iphoneincubator.com/blog/server-communication/how-to-download-a-file-only-if-it-has-been-updated
        store where it cannot be erased by iOS (separate from other cache)
        could implement as a customer NSURLProtocolHandler, in front of the other one
        load new file before proceeding
        make sure i handle both the offline and online cases
        preload cache at app install
        get rid of special no regions.json alert path, if no longer needed
        OR... use a software update style model instead? (never block user waiting for download...
            although investigate what happens to network ops if the app loses focus
        relead regions.json periodically in app (for case where people don't restart the app/phone regularly)
    get rotation and zooming working correctly on danger scale definition view
    get app rotation working in all views
    feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
    deal w/ folks not allowing location services in some way (help text? FAQ on website?)
    add a "help your avalanche center" feature to take you to donation pages?
    add more avi reference info?
    add weather info?
    add telemetry info?
    show previous days, for history? allow selecting further into the future?
    add push notifications?
    update linked components?
    make iPad experience better?
additional versions to consider
    Android version
    WinPhone version
    website version

avalanche forecast center intro/integration blurb:
--------------------
Hello,

I've recently developed a free iPhone app that displays avalanche conditions "at-a-glance", across multiple forecasting centers. My goal is to make avalanche forecasts more readily accessible to folks heading out into the backcountry. Bottom-line danger levels are shown color-coded for each forecast region on a map, based on the selected timeframe (Today/Tomorrow/2 Days Out). Clicking on any region brings up the detailed avalanche forecast from the source forecasting center. All content is cached for offline use, so you can refer back to the information you've seen even if you lose coverage in the mountains.

You can read more about the application, including reviews, and download it here: http://itunes.apple.com/app/avalanche-forecasts/id501231389?mt=8

I currently have it working with the NWAC (Northwest US), CAIC (Colorado), UAC (Utah), CAC (Canada), VIAC (Vancouver Island), and Parks Canada forecasting centers (50 regions total). My goal is to eventually include all the avalanche forecasting centers across North America.

I'd like to get your forecast center integrated. Would you please connect me with your technical point of contact?

In order to integrate technically, there are two elements i'll need:
1) forecast region definitions: do you happen to have a KMZ file (or any similar geographic data file) that describes the borders of each of your forecast regions in terms of latitude/longitude coordinate paths? If not, i can work with you to create this.
2) forecast data: I can pull the forecast information by parsing your web pages, but if you have a CAAML feed or other API that you would prefer i use, that would be great.

Thanks for your help.
