things to do for launch:
--------------------
marketing
    determine pricing (and what to say, if anything, in app blurb)!!!
    flesh out sebnarware.com/icicleventures.com website (marketing page, support page; any email addresses needed)
    app store optimization (http://www.mobiledevhq.com/ -- help with keywords, etc. -- once app is in app store)
    post on my facebook
    ping all my beta testers
    email bushwackers, wac
    reach out to avalanche centers
    get screenshots for details screens that match overview screens
v1.1
    beta test
    submit to Apple

things to do later:
--------------------
business
    set up bank-to-bank transfer between SmithBarney and USBank, via Mike Napier
    transfer money into account
    switch brinkster hosting (and other biz expenses) to biz account
    figure out better solution for sebnarware.com/icicleventures.com emails
        (brinkster aliases and forwarding didn't work to gmail, would get a delivery failure; although it would forward fine to hotmail)
        (current approach: have brinkster email accounts for each, and have gmail poll them via POP3 into my seth@pollackphoto.com account)
        (drawbacks of current approach: mail may not be polled frequently; limit of 5 accounts)
        (other issues: can do from field fine in gmail web client, but not in Apple Mail or iPhone mail)
        possible solution: keep separate accounts, but add each in my mail clients?
WS
    webservice testing
        build more unit tests
        add examples of real pages from the sites as well as other corner cases, to ensure accuracy
    support other avi centers (contact them as i go)
        Canada independents (WhistlerBlackcomb, Vancouver Island, Kananaskis)
        Utah
        Colorado
        other US (look at avalanche.org for details)
    switch to NWAC JSON api when available
    update linked components?
    staging environment?
    server-based trending?
    better monitoring (e.g. pingdom $10/mo; StillAlive $7/mo)?
iOS
    store regions.json persistently in app (where it cannot be erased by iOS)
        do an if-modified-since or equiv to update, for performance (file is large, and growing)
        get rid of special no regions.json alert path
        check and refresh regions.json periodically (requires full cleanup and reload)?
    ask for app ratings within the app?
    viral aspect -- make it easy to share via FB/twitter?
    get rotation and zooming working correctly on danger level view
    offline mode
        offline: give message if detailed view unavailable for a region?
        really stale detailed forecast content can stay in persistent cache... address by not showing content if forecasts for that region is already out of date?
    label regions with their names?
    add forecasts last fetched time (need to pull from cache or persist, for offline case)(System Font size 13; label height 18)? add refresh button for explicit refresh forecast?
    more data at-a-glance
        click on a region bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
        some suggested putting some sort of icon (ie, danger level symbol) on the forecast zone would encourage one to tap it
    feature to put in a place name, and have the map jump there; and/or have a "favorite place" you can register?
    deal w/ folks not allowing location services in some way (help text? FAQ on website?)
    add weather info?
    add telemetry info?
    add more avi reference info?
    show previous days, for history? allow selecting further into the future?
    add push notifications?
    update linked components?
    have version numbers for disclaimer accepted (use app version number)?
additional versions to consider
    Pro (paid; one time or subscription) iPhone version
    Android version
    PhoneGap version for other platforms (WinPhone, Blackberry, etc.)
