things to do:
----------
WS
    app naming
        rename Heroku app (avalanche or aviforecastws) -- "heroku rename newname"
        shorten version/1 to v1
        update client URLs, and push out new build
    support other avi centers beyond nwac
    set up unit tests (via Mocha) for the web scraping piece, with examples of real pages from the sites as well as other corner cases
    remove console messages for happy path, or switch to a real logger and turn down (via Winston)
    scale testing?
iOS
    change default zoom to be a bit wider
    recognize clicks on regions to get more details?
    design and implement real UI layout
    readable layout on non-retina displays -- replace top graphic (full screen is 480x320, or 960x640)
    info page(s)?
    drill down to details page?
    refresh regions.json periodically?
    offline caching?
    iOS4 support?
    liability warning?

    overlay avi symbols too?
    make toolbar completely transparent
    consider switching map to hybrid view mode, but if so change overlays to stand out better on this background
    startup screens
    check task switching behavior (viewDidUnload, etc.) -- what should get unloaded?
    after adding more regions
        optimization: only fetch forecasts if overlay actually gets loaded?
        management of multiple concurrent network requests?
        track and throttle global refreshes (don't refresh if already done within the last few seconds)?
    check behavior on various networks (WiFi vs. 3G vs. Edge)
    check no network behavior
    check no GPS behavior
    check low memory behavior
    attributions?
    unit tests?
 other
    beta testing (TestFlight)
    ensure accuracy!
    work with NWAC; switch to their REST api when available
