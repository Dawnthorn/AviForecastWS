    an example of a stable forecast link by region. 

http://www.nwac.us/dangerrose/preview/2227/
    an example of a generated danger rose. generated for a specific date, region, etc., with a generated URL. 400x400, on a transparent background.

avalanche levels definitions
    single image: http://www.nwac.us/media/uploads/NA_danger_scale_2010.jpg (image is 480x266)
    as text and icons: http://www.avalanche.ca/cac/bulletins/danger-scale

i've downloaded the danger scale icons. they are PDFs. source is: http://www.avalanche.org/zip/Danger_Scale_Icons.zip

KMZ/KML files for regions:
    all of Canada: http://avalanche.ca/kmz/bulletinregions.kmz
    NW: would need to define. could base on NW region map: http://www.nwac.us/media/images/avalanche-map-small.jpg but would be manual work.


basic app design concept:
----------
* overview map
    * uses the map view, zoomed out a ways, hybrid view mode; center on user's current location
    * overlay regions based on current "bottom line" avalanche forecast color (and/or icon)
    * click a region to drill to details
* details pages
    * shows the detailed forecast information for that region (including forecast timestamp, avalanche roses if available, etc.)
    * exact details will depend on the forecasting region
* information page
    * shows the level definitions, etc.


things to build:
----------
WS
    call returns data in what format? ideally atomic for consistency, although that is a bit more work. want bottom line rating, full forecast, probably other broken out fields in the future. 
    return other data fields
    support other avi centers beyond nwac
iOS
    recreate app with real name, git repository, etc.
    make networking real/robust (multipart, offline, etc.)
    figure out image display, including bundling image resources in app
    host map view
    markers/regions on map
    info page
    parsing of richer WS response format, once that is added
    drill down to details page
