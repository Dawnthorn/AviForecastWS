        alerting?
        staging env?
iOS
    data management
        performance is slow on older phones
        forecast loading
            combine the forecast lookups into one/fewer calls?
            load forecasts in order of closeness to location?
        add refresh button for explicit forecast refresh? OR add forecasts last fetched time (but has to be across all forecasts)?
        refresh regions.json periodically (requires full cleanup and reload...)?
        persistent cache
            divide into two persistent caches, must keep and want to keep but purgable by iOS5 (see http://robnapier.net/blog/offline-uiwebview-nsurlprotocol-588)?
            limit size of purgable cache?
            use cache contents even if network is available (either per regular cache rules; or as first data, before network data loads)?
    add an info page that gives instructions?
    add "3 days out", for CAC? rename "today", [tue], [wed], [thu] or similar?
    after regaining focus
        recenter on user location?
        can i make regions not redraw until new data is actually present? is the mapview invalidating all the overlays itself?
    is legend readable enough? looked just readable on iPhone 3G (consider taller&narrower font; hyphenated words; linking from legend to info page, or having it slide down or pop up)
    more data at-a-glance
        click on a region bring up "selected details" intermediate level of display, driven by the Today/Tomorrow/2DaysOut buttons?
        come up with some way to show variations in forecast by elevation zone on overview?
    liability warning?
    ask for app ratings?
