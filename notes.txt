things to do:
----------
WS
    support other avi centers
        CAC
            read up on CAAML
        pc.gc.ca
        canada independents
        other US regions
    cleanup
        clean up cache max-age settings
        use regions.json for URL lookup? (probably need separate fields for server endpoint vs. client webpage; could also store other metadata like parsing style)
    testing
        set up unit tests (via Mocha) for the web scraping piece, with examples of real pages from the sites as well as other corner cases, to ensure accuracy
        scale testing?
    operations
        remove console messages for happy path, or switch to a real logger and turn down (via Winston)
        trending? (e.g. number of requests, # of users, etc.)
        monitoring? (e.g. pingdom)
        alerting?
        staging env?
iOS
    data management
        right after phone bootup, saw some network failures once -- try to repro
        consider testing with a large number of (fake) regions, to see how everything works at scale now?
        add refresh button for explicit forecast refresh? OR add forecasts last fetched time (but has to be across all forecasts)?
        combine the forecast lookups into one/fewer calls?
        refresh regions.json periodically (requires full cleanup and reload...)?
        only fetch forecasts if overlay view actually gets loaded?
        persistent cache
            divide into two persistent caches, must keep and want to keep but purgable by iOS5 (see http://robnapier.net/blog/offline-uiwebview-nsurlprotocol-588)?
            limit size of purgable cache?
    is legend readable enough? (consider taller&narrower font; hyphenated words; linking from legend to info page, or having it slide down or pop up)
    presentation of forecasts
        come up with some way to show variations in forecast by elevation zone on overview?
    networkActivityIndicator when sub-web pages are loading after first one?
    liability warning?
    ask for app ratings?
    mapkit crash bug -- implement workaround?
