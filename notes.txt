things to do:
----------
WS
    support other avi centers
        pc.gc.ca
        Canada independents
        Utah
        Colorado
        other US
    testing
        set up unit tests (via Mocha) for the web scraping piece, with examples of real pages from the sites as well as other corner cases, to ensure accuracy
        scale testing?
    operations
        trending? (e.g. number of requests, # of users, etc.)
        monitoring? (e.g. pingdom)
        alerting?
        staging env?
iOS
    data management
        put in flurry timers for loads/reloads
        performance is slow on older phones
        consider testing with a large number of (fake) regions, to see how everything works at scale now?
        add refresh button for explicit forecast refresh? OR add forecasts last fetched time (but has to be across all forecasts)?
        combine the forecast lookups into one/fewer calls?
        refresh regions.json periodically (requires full cleanup and reload...)?
        only fetch forecasts if overlay view actually gets loaded?
        persistent cache
            divide into two persistent caches, must keep and want to keep but purgable by iOS5 (see http://robnapier.net/blog/offline-uiwebview-nsurlprotocol-588)?
            limit size of purgable cache?
            use cache contents even if network is available (either per regular cache rules; or as first data, before network data loads)?
    add "3 days out", for CAC? rename "today", [tue], [wed], [thu] or similar?
    is legend readable enough? looked just readable on iPhone 3G (consider taller&narrower font; hyphenated words; linking from legend to info page, or having it slide down or pop up)
    presentation of forecasts
        come up with some way to show variations in forecast by elevation zone on overview?
    liability warning?
    ask for app ratings?
    mapkit crash bug -- implement workaround?
