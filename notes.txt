notes on regions:
----------
Canada:
* 12 regions with regular CAC forecasts
* 2 regions under CAC, but with no real forecasts (Bighorn, North Rockies)
* 4 from pc.gc.ca for national parks
* 3 independents (WhistlerBlackcomb, Vancouver Island, Kananaskis)


things to do:
----------
iOS
    make legend more readable (consider a vertical stack, overlaid on map? or hyphenated words)?
    data management
        offline data caching?
        add refresh button for explicit forecast refresh? OR add forecasts last fetched time (but has to be across all forecasts)?
        track and throttle global refreshes (don't refresh if already done within the last few seconds)?
        refresh regions.json periodically (may be hard...)?
        only fetch forecasts if overlay view actually gets loaded?
        am i going to have to combine the forecast lookups into one/fewer calls?
    liability warning?
    ask for app ratings?
    mapkit crash bug?
