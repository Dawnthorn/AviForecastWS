The avalanche hazard rating for the Selkirk and Cabinet Mountains is MODERATE on&nbsp; slopes steeper than 35 degrees above 5,000 feet.&nbsp; On slopes less than 35 degrees or below 5,000 feet the hazard is rated as LOW.&nbsp;<br> <br> As we all know, avalanche conditions are dynamic and can change for better or worse continually. Use this forecast as a tool in your box.&nbsp; Backcountry travelers should be prepared to assess current conditions for themselves, plan their routes of travel accordingly, and never travel alone. Backcountry travelers can reduce their exposure to avalanche hazards by utilizing timbered trails and ridge routes and by avoiding open and exposed terrain with slope angles of 30 degrees or more. Backcountry travelers should carry the necessary avalanche rescue equipment such as a shovel, avalanche probe or probe ski poles, a rescue beacon and a well-equipped first aid kit.<br> </div> </div>  <div> <div id="371824661452829444" align="left" style="width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden;" class="wcustomhtml"><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1obrOzv-yoJGi0jBK8kz01yoO0BNJr50ZrhERFiPDlcY/pub?w=662&amp;h=100"></div> </div>  <div> <div id="473541896188904168" align="left" style="width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden;" class="wcustomhtml"><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1psqj92RHIz4CTJnIhEQnzXcAw1Cob1Ql5nhmTYaPh_k/pub?w=634&amp;h=251"></div> </div> </div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.idahopanhandleavalanche.org%2F5%2Fpost%2F2013%2F12%2Favalanche-advisory-122013.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://www.idahopanhandleavalanche.org/5/post/2013/12/avalanche-advisory-122013.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

Today is December 03, 2013. This is a preseason update to let you know that we will be starting our weekly advisories next week December 12th. &nbsp;IPAC is looking forward to another winter of avalanche forecasting and education.&nbsp; We have plans to cooperate more with The Friends of IPAC to make our advisory better and offer more avalanche classes and workshops to the public.&nbsp; If you have a group that would benefit from taking one of our classes let us know.&nbsp; We offer a variety of classes to Search and Rescue, law enforcement, ski patrol, and winter sports clubs.&nbsp; If we can't help you out we're connected with others who work in the snow sports and education field.&nbsp; We'll be making improvements to our website so keep us on your favorites list and if you have suggestions contact us.&nbsp; If you are interested in getting involved with IPAC you can assist through The Friends of IPAC and help with avalanche awareness classes for local schools, planning events, and getting out with experienced forecasters for the avalanche advisory.<br />Recent Observations are posted on our site under the Avy Obs tab from Tom Eddy and Peter Bock through December 1st. &nbsp;I made a quick trip up to the the Selkirk Crest yesterday morning and found an unpleasant breakable ice crust all the way to 6200 feet from the rain that fell on top of our fresh snow Sunday afternoon. &nbsp;We received about 4 inches of fluff last night with high winds that is on a thin crust up high and a thicker crust as you decrease in elevation. &nbsp;Wind loaded aspects may be sketchy on the crust. I am sure that there are wind slabs of variable depths on top of the ice crust and another slab sitting on the surface hoar and near surface facets that formed during our last high pressure. &nbsp;<br />Avalanche conditions change for better or worse continually. Backcountry travelers should be prepared to assess current conditions for themselves, plan their routes of travel accordingly, and never travel alone. Backcountry travelers can reduce their exposure to avalanche hazards by utilizing timbered trails and ridge routes and by avoiding open and exposed terrain with slope angles of 30 degrees or more.

This is a preseason update to let  you know that we are still here and yes, we did notice that snow in the  mountains.&nbsp; IPAC is looking forward to another winter of avalanche  forecasting and education.&nbsp; We have plans to cooperate more with The  Friends of IPAC to make our advisory better and offer more avalanche  classes and workshops to the public.&nbsp; If you have a group that would  benefit from taking one of our classes let us know.&nbsp; We offer a variety  of classes to Search and Rescue, law enforcement, ski patrol, and winter  sports clubs.&nbsp; If we can't help you out we're connected with others who  work in the snow sports and education field.&nbsp; We'll be making  improvements to our website so keep us on your favorites list and if you  have suggestions contact us.&nbsp; If you are interested in getting involved  with IPAC you can assist through The Friends of IPAC and help with  avalanche awareness classes for local schools, planning events, and  getting out with experienced forecasters for the avalanche advisory.<br />Looking at the possibilities for Winter 2014, check out this website: http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/90day/.&nbsp; By the looks of things there is a fair chance that we will have early snows in the mountains accompanied by milder temperatures.&nbsp; The longer range looks like an equal chance for precipitation and temperatures to be above or below average conditions.&nbsp; This seems to be backed up by ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscilliation) forecasts of neutral through this winter.&nbsp; You might also want to see what Hayden Lake's Cliff Harris says, or my go to, Bill Neimi from Sandpoint.&nbsp; I personally am going with the fact that this was an exceptional year for bees, they're still hanging on in places, and that gives us an above average chance for heavy snowfall this winter.&nbsp; Speaking of hanging on, there may be high elevation north faces that could hold this early season snow.&nbsp; Watch for more early season snow that may accumulate and stick on sheltered slopes.&nbsp; If it gets to be a foot deep or more and then sits around for a few weeks and recrystallizes, that is the forming of a rotten base and could become a dangerous early season weak layer.&nbsp; Hunters, pay attention to steep terrain with more than a few inches of snow, especially wind-blown snow, it could slide.&nbsp; It's time to start paying attention, winter is coming.&nbsp; I'm 100% certain of that.<br />   Avalanche conditions change for better or worse continually.  Backcountry travelers should be prepared to assess current conditions  for themselves, plan their routes of travel accordingly, and never  travel alone. Backcountry travelers can reduce their exposure to  avalanche hazards by utilizing timbered trails and ridge routes and by  avoiding open and exposed terrain with slope angles of 30 degrees or  more. Backcountry travelers should carry the necessary avalanche rescue  equipment such as a shovel, avalanche probe or probe ski poles, a rescue  beacon and a well-equipped first aid kit.<br /><br />  Have a safe and pleasant Autumn!</div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.idahopanhandleavalanche.org%2F5%2Fpost%2F2013%2F10%2Fpreseason-update-october-10-2013.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://www.idahopanhandleavalanche.org/5/post/2013/10/preseason-update-october-10-2013.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

Special thanks to Idaho Parks and Recreation for sponsoring this morning's advisory.&nbsp; Thanks to everyone who assisted IPAC with the advisory and classes this winter, we really appreciate your help.&nbsp; This will be the last advisory for this winter.&nbsp; We'll post the spring riding tips next week.&nbsp; Spring is here!<br> <br> <strong style="">Mountain Weather&nbsp;</strong><br> <br> Mild weather will persist over North Idaho for the weekend and we may not get overnight freezing.<br> Today:&nbsp; Chance of showers, 5,900' freezing level, 41 degrees, SW wind at 6-9mph.<br> Tonight:&nbsp; Partly cloudy, 31 degrees, and SW winds 7mph.<br> Saturday: Mostly sunny, 45 degrees, and SW winds 3-7mph.<br> Sunday:&nbsp; Mostly sunny, 48 degrees, light winds.<br> <strong style="">The</strong> <strong style="">avalanche danger will depend on solar intensity, aspect, and whether it freezes at night.</strong><br> <br> <strong style="">Snowpack and Avalanche Discussion&nbsp;</strong><br> It was warm in the mountains yesterday.&nbsp; The surface snow was wet and heavy and that was at 6,000 feet.&nbsp; Over a crust you'll find about 1 foot of wet snow on E, N, and W aspects.&nbsp; South aspects are mostly firm where sheltered and melted crust where exposed.&nbsp; The layering of the upper pack does pose some concerns for when the sun becomes intense or the thermometer goes over 50 degrees.&nbsp; With the isothermal, wet snow over the crust the heating from the sun will concentrate above that crust and create the possibility for triggering wet slides on the crust.&nbsp; I got some of it moving yesterday on a steep west aspect and it was like flowing concrete.&nbsp; Hard to get out of too.&nbsp; These conditions can improve but we need freezing temperatures overnight and then you have to plan your route to get off slopes as they are heating up.&nbsp; Not much of a freeze last night so expect that today you'll want to watch stability of that wet slab over the crust.&nbsp; It snowed a little late in the day so you may find dust on crust if the surface froze enough.The avalanche hazard rating for the Selkirk and Cabinet Mountains is MODERATE on&nbsp; slopes steeper than 35 degrees above 5,000 feet.&nbsp; On slopes less than 35 degrees or below 5,000 feet the hazard is rated as LOW.&nbsp;<br> <br> Avalanche conditions change for better or worse continually.

Special thanks to Idaho Parks and Recreation for sponsoring this morning's advisory. &nbsp;Thanks also to Schweitzer Mountain Ski Patrol for observations from the mountain and Lance Gidley for assisting with the avalanche hunting yesterday. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong style="">Weather&nbsp;</strong><br />Today, the NWS is calling for an 80% chance of precipitation, note - not snow, and the accumulations will be nil. &nbsp;Freezing level should be around 5,500 feet but look for variations on this. &nbsp;At &nbsp;6AM temperatures around the region were at 34 degrees at about 5,000 feet. &nbsp;High temperature today will be 38 and winds will be out of the SW at 15mph with gusts to 22. &nbsp;Tonight, will be mostly cloudy, highs in the low-30s and SW winds 11-14mph. &nbsp;The outlook calls for a 60% chance of rain to 5,800 feet, 40 degrees, and SW winds 8-10mph on Saturday. &nbsp;By the evening temperatures drop and it will begin to snow, with 3-5 inches expected. &nbsp;Look for SW winds at 9-14 transporting snow. &nbsp;Sunday it keeps snowing with an additional 2-4 inches and increasing west winds. &nbsp;<strong style="">Avalanche danger could peak at CONSIDERABLE today or this evening with warming temperatures and rain and decrease with colder temps by Saturday evening.</strong><br /><br /><strong style="">Snowpack and Avalanche Discussion&nbsp;</strong><br />No solid overnight freeze last night is the first thing to consider. &nbsp;Up on Trestle Ridge in the Cabinets we found fairly stable snow on all aspects but a couple layers, especially on a W aspect had us staying off the steep and exposed slopes. &nbsp;What you'll find in the pack on most aspects is stabilizing weak layers in the new snow from this week about 8 inches deep and some graupel layers, BB's, one at about 16 inches and the other deeper, about 2 feet. &nbsp;The upper 2-3 feet of pack has changes in density due to storm snow changes and older sugary layers that have faceted. &nbsp;There is an old surface hoar layer that has stabilized much but still shears with moderate force at 1.5 feet deep. &nbsp;Eric was up on Abandon Peak in the kirks and found good conditions, the buried surface hoar layer 2 feet deep, and some shallower weak layers around decomposing crusts. &nbsp;Warming temperatures may create some problems with the pack depending on how fast it warms and if we get rain. &nbsp;It doesn't seem like we'll get that much rain and that could save us from potentially high hazard. &nbsp;I'd just play it safe today and tomorrow during the thaw and wait for the good stuff come Sunday. &nbsp;If we're lucky the surface won't refreeze into a brick. &nbsp;The avalanche hazard rating for the Selkirk and Cabinet Mountains is rated as&nbsp;<strong style="">MODERATE&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;on slopes steeper than 35 degrees above 5,000 feet but could increase to Considerable this afternoon with rapid warming and possibly rain. &nbsp;Avalanche hazard is rated as Low on slopes less than 35 degrees. &nbsp;<br /><br />As we should all be aware....Avalanche conditions change for better or worse continually. Backcountry travelers should be prepared to assess current conditions for themselves, plan their routes of travel accordingly, and never travel alone. Backcountry travelers can reduce their exposure to avalanche hazards by utilizing timbered trails and ridge routes and by avoiding open and exposed terrain with slope angles of 30 degrees or more. Backcountry travelers should carry the necessary avalanche rescue equipment such as a shovel, avalanche probe or probe ski poles, a rescue beacon and a well-equipped first aid kit.<br /><br />Have a safe and pleasant weekend.<br /></div>  <div><div style="height: 20px; overflow: hidden; width: 100%;"></div> <hr class="styled-hr" style="width:100%;"></hr> <div style="height: 20px; overflow: hidden; width: 100%;"></div></div>  <div><div id="983715957424696499" align="left" style="width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden;" class="wcustomhtml"><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1obrOzv-yoJGi0jBK8kz01yoO0BNJr50ZrhERFiPDlcY/pub?w=662&amp;h=100"></div>    </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.idahopanhandleavalanche.org%2F5%2Fpost%2F2013%2F03%2Favalanche-advisory-march-1st-2013.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://www.idahopanhandleavalanche.org/5/post/2013/03/avalanche-advisory-march-1st-2013.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

Special thanks to Idaho Parks and Recreation for sponsoring this morning's advisory. &nbsp;Thanks also to Schweitzer Mountain Ski Patrol for observations from the mountain and Scott Rulander for assisting with the avalanche hunting yesterday. &nbsp;<br /><br /><STRONG>Weather&nbsp;</STRONG><br />Today, NWS is calling for 4-8 inches of new snow!!! 26 degrees, and W winds at 10-15 increasing to 24 with 37mph gusts . &nbsp;Tonight, &nbsp;will be mostly snowy with temperatures dropping to the upper teens and SW winds up to 30mph, picking up to 4 more inches, possibly more in the Cabinets.&nbsp; This seems to be bringing in a warm moist system for Saturday.&nbsp; The outlook for the weekend calls for 70% chance of a few more inches of new snow Saturday with high temperatures around 26 degrees and continued W'erly winds in the 20mph range. &nbsp;Saturday night snowfall tapers to 1 inch possible, temperatures down to 20 with winds subsiding. Sunday weather continues to be mostly cloudy and cool, less winds and maybe another 1/2 inch of snow. &nbsp;<STRONG>Avalanche danger will increase due to new snow and windloading for the outlook period.</STRONG><br /><br /><STRONG>Snowpack and Avalanche Discussion&nbsp;</STRONG><br />Yesterday Scott and I headed into the backcountry out of Schweitzer expecting to see low hazard conditions, stuck our head in the snow, once on accident, and what did we find....but a couple layers of Surface Hoar!!! about a foot and a half deep, failed with an Extended Column Test ECP18 Q1 and Compression Test CTM16 Q1, moderate force, but shears were fast and clean.&nbsp; There was another surface hoar layer about 4 inches down that did not react....Yet!!!! &nbsp;I am concerned with the new snow and the windloading taking place and the stability of those surface hoar layers today and Saturday. There is alot of variability in the snowpack and the distribution of the surface hoar, but I found it on a NW aspect and I am sure it is to be found elsewhere where slopes are sheltered from the wind and sun. &nbsp;We had a Rutschblock Test RB-4 (one jump) on the 18 inch deep surface hoar layer with lots of energy on a 40 degree slope. New snow will be loading onto the weak layers identified and will require the snowgoer to be on their game. &nbsp;The avalanche hazard rating for the Selkirk and Cabinet Mountains is rated as <STRONG>Considerable </STRONG>&nbsp;on slopes steeper than 35 degrees above 5,000 feet. &nbsp;Avalanche hazard is rated as Moderate on slopes less than 35 degrees.<br /><br />As we should all be aware....Avalanche conditions change for better or worse continually. Backcountry travelers should be prepared to assess current conditions for themselves, plan their routes of travel accordingly, and never travel alone. Backcountry travelers can reduce their exposure to avalanche hazards by utilizing timbered trails and ridge routes and by avoiding open and exposed terrain with slope angles of 30 degrees or more.
