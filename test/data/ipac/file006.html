It will tighten up by tonight,  we'll have another crust, and possibly another avalanche concern with  the new snow on that crust.&nbsp; The avalanche hazard rating for the St. Regis Basin and Silver Valley is <span style="font-weight: bold;">MODERATE</span> on slopes steeper than 35 degrees above 5,000 feet.&nbsp; Below 5,000 feet and on slopes less than 35 degrees the hazard is rated as <span style="font-weight: bold;">LOW</span>.&nbsp; <br /> <br />  Avalanche conditions change  for better or worse continually. Use this  forecast as a tool in your  box.&nbsp; Backcountry travelers should be  prepared to assess current  conditions for themselves, plan their routes  of travel accordingly, and  never travel alone. Backcountry travelers  can reduce their exposure to  avalanche hazards by utilizing timbered  trails and ridge routes and by  avoiding open and exposed terrain with  slope angles of 30 degrees or  more. Backcountry travelers should carry  the necessary avalanche rescue  equipment such as a shovel, avalanche  probe or probe ski poles, a rescue  beacon and a well-equipped first aid  kit.&nbsp; </div>  <div><div style="height: 20px; overflow: hidden; width: 100%;"></div> <hr class="styled-hr" style="width:100%;"></hr> <div style="height: 20px; overflow: hidden; width: 100%;"></div></div>  <div><div id="257698583631185164" align="left" style="width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden;" class="wcustomhtml"><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1obrOzv-yoJGi0jBK8kz01yoO0BNJr50ZrhERFiPDlcY/pub?w=662&amp;h=100"></div>    </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.idahopanhandleavalanche.org%2F4%2Fpost%2F2013%2F03%2Favalanche-advisory-march-15-2013.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://www.idahopanhandleavalanche.org/4/post/2013/03/avalanche-advisory-march-15-2013.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

The avalanche hazard rating for the Silver Valley and St. Regis Basin &nbsp;is rated as&nbsp;<strong style="">CONSIDERABLE&nbsp;</strong>on slopes steeper than 35 degrees above 4,500 feet on all aspects. &nbsp;Avalanche hazard is rated as Moderate on slopes less than 35 degrees. &nbsp;The avalanche danger is expected to increase with warming temperatures before it begins to stabilize, bond and consolidate.<br /> <br /> Avalanche conditions change for better or worse continually. Use this forecast as one and not your only tool in your box.&nbsp; Backcountry travelers should be prepared to assess current conditions for themselves, plan their routes of travel accordingly, and never travel alone. Backcountry travelers can reduce their exposure to avalanche hazards by utilizing timbered trails and ridge routes and by avoiding open and exposed terrain with slope angles of 30 degrees or more. Backcountry travelers should carry the necessary avalanche rescue equipment such as a shovel, avalanche probe or probe ski poles, a rescue beacon and a well-equipped first aid kit.&nbsp; A <strong style="">knowledgeable and dependable</strong> partner is always a plus as well.<br /> <br /> Enjoy the sun, but be cautious and have a safe and pleasant weekend!&nbsp; Remember &ldquo;is the slope steep enough to slide today&rdquo;<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span></div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>  <div><div id="513671221887745499" align="left" style="width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden;" class="wcustomhtml"><img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/14UX-ooor2ZBskwBPbsi5JI570gpKe8l1m9U08zZFeKA/pub?w=717&amp;h=103"></div>    </div></div><div class='blog-social'><div class='blog-social-item'><a class='twitter-share-button' href='http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.idahopanhandleavalanche.org%2F4%2Fpost%2F2013%2F03%2Favalanche-advisory-march-8th-2013.html' data-count='horizontal'></a></div><div class='blog-social-item blog-fb-like'><fb:like href='http://www.idahopanhandleavalanche.org/4/post/2013/03/avalanche-advisory-march-8th-2013.html' show_faces='false' layout='button_count' width='90'></fb:like></div><div style='clear:both'></div></div>

Special thanks to Idaho Parks and Recreation for sponsoring this morning's advisory. &nbsp;Thanks to Ty Foltz at Silver Mountain for the obs, and Joel Kopf down south out of the Clearwaters.<br /><br /><strong style="">Weather&nbsp;</strong><br />Today, the NWS is calling for an 80% chance of less than 1 inch of new snow above 5,500 feet, with temperatures rising to 38 degrees and SW winds at 15-18 and gusts to 25mph. &nbsp;At &nbsp;6AM temperatures around the region were at 34 degrees at about 5,000 feet. &nbsp;Tonight will be cloudy and temperatures only dropping to 34 degrees with S winds at 15. &nbsp;The outlook calls for cloudy on Saturday with temperatures up to 39 degrees and SW winds at 5-9. &nbsp;By the evening though you can expect a 100% chance of 3-7 inches of new snow falling at 28 degrees with SW winds at 10-14 and gusts to 18mph. &nbsp;Sunday shows 2-4 more inches of snow, 30 degrees, and W winds. &nbsp;<strong style="">Avalanche danger may peak today with warming temperatures and possibly rain and then decrease by Saturday evening with colder weather.</strong><br /><br /><strong style="">Snowpack and Avalanche Discussion&nbsp;</strong><br />In the Basin yesterday, Carole and Dan fond some weak layers in the upper storm snow around changes in density. &nbsp;These should be stabilizing as they settle. &nbsp;Watch for movement in these surface weak layers as the temperatures warm today. &nbsp;They found some degree of shearing in these layers on multiple aspects. &nbsp;Deeper in the pack they got moderate shears on the buried surface hoar layer almost 3 feet deep. &nbsp;It would take alot to trigger this but with conditions rapidly changing today, and the possibility of rain, it would be best to play it safe and avoid steep, exposed terrain, especially where wind-loaded. &nbsp;On Grandmother Mt at 6,000 feet, Joel found a more stable pack with some moderate shears in light new snow about one foot deep. &nbsp;The avalanche hazard rating for the Coeur d Alene and St. Joe Mountains is rated as&nbsp;<strong style="">MODERATE&nbsp;</strong>on slopes steeper than 35 degrees above 5,000 feet and could rise to Considerable this afternoon with rapidly rising temperatures and possibly rain, especially on wind-loaded aspects. &nbsp;Avalanche hazard is rated as Low on slopes less than 35 degrees.<br /><br />As we should all be aware....Avalanche conditions change for better or worse continually. Backcountry travelers should be prepared to assess current conditions for themselves, plan their routes of travel accordingly, and never travel alone. Backcountry travelers can reduce their exposure to avalanche hazards by utilizing timbered trails and ridge routes and by avoiding open and exposed terrain with slope angles of 30 degrees or more.
