    "detailed_forecast_day2": "<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Thanksgiving Day... </span></strong>A building upper level ridge is expected thru Thursday and Thursday night. This should provide a fair day with mainly higher based clouds or sunshine and a briefly cool northwest flow aloft. This weather should allow for a continued decrease in the avalanche danger as any recent storm slabs or wind slabs continue to settle and stabilize. Continue to assess local conditions carefully, especially when venturing to higher elevations above 6000 feet and on any previously wind loaded terrain regardless of elevations.&nbsp; The snowpack should stabilize more quickly at lower and mid elevations.</p>\r\n<p>Please also be aware that rising freezing levels and increasing winds are expected later Thursday  and Thursday night in advance of a stronger frontal system expecte to  move into the area Friday morning. This weather should produce a slow  increase in the avalanche danger later Thursday into early Friday with a more significant increase likely on Friday.</p>\r\n<p>There might just be some pretty exciting early season backcountry conditions to be thankful for, but continue to be diligent in assessing your personal risk as you go about enjoying them! Welcome to winter!</p>",
    "detailed_forecast_day1": "<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wednesday morning to midday</span></strong>... After gradually decreasing showers and slow cooling overnight, a moderate strength frontal system should move over the region Wednesday morning spreading from south to north. This system should cause moderate winds, strongest in the Mt Hood area and mostly moderate snowfall at slow and gradual cooling.&nbsp; Snow should change to decreasing showers Wednesday afternoon and further decrease Wednesday night as a ridge of high pressure begins building offshore.</p>\r\n<p>The expected system Wednesday should cause a gradual increase in the danger through midday Wednesday. New shallow storm slabs should form over settling older snow or crust layers. The expected bond to any exposed crust or refreezing older wet snow should be relatively good.&nbsp; The expected increase in danger should be due mainly to these new storm snow soft slab deposits on a variety of aspects, but mainly from northwest thru east facing terrain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The exception may be in the north Cascades near Washington Pass and nearer to 7000 feet along the crest that may be void of any stabilizing crust layers. In these areas, a deeper snowpack both void of crust layers as well as fewer early season anchors, may allow any initial slides triggered in the surface snow to step to older snow layers, especially in areas where a buried surface hoar layer may exist.</p>\r\n<p>Just because it is late November, don't be fooled about triggering avalanches. Take extra precautions, practice cautious route-finding and careful snowpack evaluation. Remember that local slope conditions may vary greatly from those described in a regionally based avalanche forecast.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wednesday afternoon and night</span></strong>...Following the last   front in the current series Wednesday morning, a cool but decreasing showery flow   should persist late Wednesday. This should allow new snowfall to   slowly settle along with a slow decrease in the danger.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "snowpack_analysis": "<p><strong>Recent weather, snowfall amounts and avalanches...</strong></p>\r\n<p>Prior to last weekend areas most low and intermediate  elevation areas had a relatively shallow snowpack full of many  terrain and vegetative anchors. Higher elevations above about 5000 feet in the north and 6000 feet in the south had a gradual accumulation of  generally stable snow, but mostly less than a few feet.</p>\r\n<p>Last Wednesday and Thursday during fair weather, there were several reports of widespread but generally small surface hoar prior to the onset of the recent storms.</p>\r\n<p>A series of increasingly strong and wet storms arrived beginning late last Friday, culminating with the strongest frontal system moving through the region Monday.&nbsp; Snowfall amounts of  2-3 feet have accumulated above about 4-5000 feet in the north and 5-6000 feet in the south,  with up to 12-18 inches at lower elevations. This has produced a snowpack depth ranging from 10-20 inches below 4000 feet and up to 40-50 inches above 5000 feet.</p>\r\n<p>The warming and heavy wet snow and or mixed rain or snow or rain by mid-day Monday produced natural storm snow slab avalanches. Slabs of 10-20 inches with good propagation were reported by Mt Baker ski patrol professionals working on controlling the ski area in preparation of opening. Most slides initiated from about 4700 feet or higher and on NW through NE aspects.&nbsp; Slides were also seen on Shuksan Arm and Table Mountain with similar sizes.</p>\r\n<p>A natural slab also released above the highway at Washington Pass from the Liberty Bell #2 slidepath near noon Monday. The avalanche deposited slide debris 15 ft wide by 40 ft deep onto the highway.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Field reports  from the Mission Ridge area indicated that 8-12 inch soft  slabs were releasing by both ski cut and snowcat operations during the maximum warming on Monday, along with some natural slab activity of 6-12 inches. Subsequent pits Tuesday morning at Mission Ridge near 6200 feet revealed a buried layer of thin surface hoar down about 8-10\" inches producing very clean and easy compression test results. Also noted was a second deeper layer down about 16-20\" producing similar results. Total snowdepths in the Mission Ridge area near 6200 feet averaged about 2 feet with some deeper wind loaded areas.</p>\r\n<p>As of late Tuesday, decreasing showers and slight cooling has allowed for a crust of varying strengths to form at most mid and upper elevations, mainly above 5000 feet and in the north and 6000 feet in the south. Weak to moderate surface crusts now bridge over the 1-3 feet of wet heavy snow deposited over the past few days. Most sites from mid to lower elevations are void of any surface crust as temperatures have remained mostly above freezing with generally 1-2 feet of settling wet snow. Also significant vegetative and terrain anchoring at lower elevations are helping to pin the snow in place and limit the avalanche danger on many slopes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong></strong></span></p>"
