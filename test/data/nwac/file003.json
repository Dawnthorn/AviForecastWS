  "snowpack_analysis": "<p>The Olympics and north Cascades received heavy snow during an active  weather pattern in mid December followed by a 10 day stretch of  benign weather lasting until light snow returned on January 4th. This  period featured high pressure and weak splitting  frontal systems that  allowed for significant storm snow settlement.</p>\r\n<p>Two strong frontal systems in strong westerly flow aloft impacted the   Pacific Northwest Monday and Tuesday bringing widely swinging snow  levels, strong westerly ridgetop winds, switching pass level  winds, and  periods of heavy snow and rain. This caused avalanche  cycles mainly  Monday morning and again Tuesday afternoon, especially  in the passes  which experienced rapid warming and rain following heavy  snowfall.  Avalanches released within new storm layers or near crusts from the  previous benign weather.</p>\r\n<p>A cold frontal passage Wednesday morning brought in much colder air with plummeting snow levels, decreasing winds and snow showers.&nbsp; New mostly supportable rain crusts formed followed by about 6-12 inches of much lower density snow from Wednesday morning to Friday morning.</p>\r\n<p>In most areas a generally stable snow profile consists of low density snow ranging from a dusting up to about a foot overlying one or several crust layers. These upper snowpack layers overlie the settled deep snow from late December. The best snow conditions are found on lower to moderate angled slopes holding the most new snow. Wind exposed slopes and ridges remain scoured to the crust layers. Some areas above 6000 feet may have limited or possibly no crust layers and deeper recent snowfall.</p>\r\n<p>Reports from Friday for this area indicate only isolated pockets of shallow or small wind or storm slab. No reports of avalanches were received for this area for Saturday or Sunday with most reports identifying to supportable crust layers in the upper snowpack as the reason. Sun crusts are also developing despite cold temperatures on southerly facing slopes Friday thru Sunday.</p>"
