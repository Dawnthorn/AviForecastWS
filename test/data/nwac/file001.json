  "detailed_forecast_day2": "<p>Moderate to heavy snow showers in the north and central WA Cascades and Olympics...and moderate to heavy snow in the southern Cascades...should slowly decrease later Thursday morning, with moderate snow showers expected to further decrease Thursday afternoon and light to moderate showers Thursday night. Along with generally decreasing winds and continued low and lowering freezing levels, this should produce a slow decrease in the danger as new storm and wind slabs start to settle. However, the expected low freezing levels and relatively cold temperatures should make this setttlement and stabilization a slow process with unstable wind slabs likely persisting on more heavily loaded lee terrain thru late Thursday.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Concerns</strong> should focus on very slowly settling and still dangerous <strong>wind slabs</strong> on north through east exposures at higher elevations and on west facing slopes near the Cascade passes. Also, settling <strong>storm slabs</strong> should remain an issue on a variety of steeper lee terrain where no recent avalanche activity is noted. Although the potential for natural slide activity should decrease on Thursday, human triggered slides should remain likely and both good route finding and conservative decision making are strongly urged.</p>", 
  "detailed_forecast_day1": "<p>A strong frontal system should move over the region Wednesday. This front should bring increasing light to moderate snowfall Wednesday morning and moderate to heavy snow Wednesday afternoon and night, along with only a slight warming trend (mainly in the south) and strongly increasing ridgetop and pass winds. At higher elevations in the Olympics and Cascades away from the passes, the strong winds should primarily load northwest and north facing slopes near higher ridges early in the day, with greatest loading at mid and higher elevations spreading to northeast aspects in the afternoon.&nbsp; However, near the Cascade passes very strong easterly winds should primarily load northwest through southwest facing slopes as well as a variety of differing exposures in adjacent higher terrain where pass and free air winds should slowly mix. The associated generally high avalanche danger from denser wind and storm slab snow should spread to most  steeper terrain above about 4000 feet mid-late Wednesday with  increasing and considerable avalanche danger likely elsewhere.</p>\r\n<p>Increased loading by dense wind driven snow should make for increasingly sensitive and progressively large slabs thru the day on Wednesday. Further shooting cracks are possible along with a potential for remotely triggered slides near higher ridgelines. Also, some increasingly large and unstable cornices are likely and these...as well as underlying terrain...should be avoided. While most avalanche activity should involve primarily the most recent new snow from the arriving snow releasing on the lower density snow layers received during decreasing showers and winds later Tuesday, some slides may break thru into more deeply buried weak layers formed last weekend...especially on steeper lee terrain not showing evidence of recent slide releases...where slide depths may reach 3-5 feet.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Concerns:</span></strong> After some brief settlement and stabilization<strong> </strong>mid to late Tuesday,<strong> Storm slab</strong> layers should rapidly rebuild  Wednesday. The denser wind driven snowfall should load and stress  existing weak low  density snow and older buried slabs on all aspects,  but especially lee slopes from northwest to  east and southeast facing in higher terrain and more westerly exposures near the passes.  Some sensitive avalanches initiating in near  surface layers may break  to other more deeply buried weak layers or down  to a rain crust in  those areas where this layer exists.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wind Slab: </strong>Strong and shifting winds along with a period of  heavy snowfall  should build new areas of wind slab. Any slides  releasing in new wind slab layers may trigger deeper weaknesses or older  slabs, potentially reaching up to 3-5 feet or more on some lee slopes at higher   elevations, mainly northwest through southeast facing showing no evidence of recent avalanche activity.</p>\r\n<p>Very dangerous avalanche conditions are expected Wednesday in most avalanche terrain above about 4000 feet, with dangerous conditions elsewhere...and backcountry travel is not recommended.</p>",

  "snowpack_analysis": "<p>The very strong storm system and following strong westerly flow late Sunday through early Tuesday loaded a variety of many buried weak layers with substantial and much denser new storm snow and wind slab, spreading generally high danger to lower elevations. Many natural, human triggered and controlled avalanches were reported during the past 24-36 hours, along with some shooting cracks and several remotely triggered avalanche...the most recent near the top of Alpental Tuesday morning. While no injuries have been reported, there have been several close calls, including some reports of deep snow burials near tree wells. BC and ski area travelers should be sure to travel with someone and keep close watch on their partner as they descend. For more information on deep snow immersion and potential suffocation, please see this <a href=\"http://www.treewelldeepsnowsafety.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">link </a>for further information.</p>\r\n<p>Otherwise...the recent heavy snowfall (ranging from about 20 to over  40  inches near and west of the Cascade crest and 12-20 inches along the   Cascade east slopes) that had begun to slowly settle (up to about 8-15  inches  as of mid-day Tuesday) should continue to gradually settle  Tuesday  afternoon and evening in slowly decreasing showers and winds.  Along with  substantial previous avalanche activity, such settlement and  slow  stabilization are allowing for a gradual and relatively brief  decrease  in the avalanche danger...and an associated slightly  decreasing  potential for human triggered slides in steeper wind loaded  terrain. However, despite a diminishing potential for both 1-2 ft storm   slabs and generally deeper (up to 3-4 feet or more) wind slabs, some  isolated wind slabs involving more deeply buried weaknesses may stilll  linger thru late Tuesday. In general, the most heavily  wind affected  areas currently lie on north thru east exposures, although  other slope  exposures may be cross loaded depending on surrounding  terrain.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the lighter snow showers, cool temperatures and decreased winds Tuesday afternoon are producing weaker lower density snow layers over the previously received and generally firmer wind deposited snow received Sunday night through early Tuesday. This new weak snow layer should become a significant factor in producing increased avalanche danger when buried and loaded by increasingly heavy amounts of much denser and more strongly wind deposited snow layers likely arriving late Tuesday night and Wednesday.</p>"
