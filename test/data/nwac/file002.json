    "detailed_forecast_day2": "<p>Another weak upper level disturbance should move out of the large offshore upper low and weakly over the region on Saturday. This should produce further mostly minor snow accumulations...mainly on the order of 2-4 inches or less...in most areas, along with some wind transport...strongest near heavier showers. Along with continued low and lowering freezing levels and gradually increasing winds at higher elevations, this should maintain the threat of some shallow storm or wind slab snow on steeper lee terrain above about 5 to 6000 feet along with some shallow storm snow or loose slide activity on steeper smooth terrain down to about 4 to 5000 feet. While natural slide activity is unlikely, especially at lower elevations, some human triggered shallow slabs may be possible on higher and steeper wind exposed terrain and back country travelers should identify features of concern and plan routes accordingly. Some of the denser and new wind slab layers may overlie weaker layers of facets which  developed as a result of both the colder weather early this week and the overall  shallow snowpack.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Concern #1--Wind slab snow:</strong> increasing wind transport  of previously deposited snow should gradually develop increasingly  dense wind slabs over some weaker faceting snow layers on west through  north exposures, especially above 6000 feet where strongest winds are  expected. Travelers should be aware of the increasing potential for  human triggered avalanches.</p>\r\n<p>The next storm should approach on Saturday night causing increasing southwest ridgetop winds, increasing snow and warming temperatures. This should build new wind slab layers on various mainly lee slopes. An increasing avalanche danger is expected Saturday night.</p>",

    "snowpack_analysis": "<p>Gradually increasing amounts of new snow have fallen since last weekend, with automated weather stations indicating up to about 12 to 20 inches of snow depth above 5 to 6000 feet. This new snow has fallen with varying wind speeds and directions, but has mostly been transported to west, northwest and north exposures. While the overall shallow snowcover at lower elevations (below 5000 ft) is combining with signficant vegetational anchoring to produce generally low danger in most locations below about 5000 feet, back country travelelers should be aware of the potential for some small loose slides or sluffs at lower elevations, mainly in steeper terrain having a smooth underlying ground surface. It should also be noted that while any avalanche activity should be small, contact with brush or rocks in the shallow snowpack may produce injury.</p>\r\n<p>Also, with cold temperatures expected over the next few days and a rather shallow snowpack in most locations, some faceting and weakening of the existing snow layers is likely. This early season faceting may provide a weak layer for subsequent snowfall if not destroyed by some brief sun later this week and rain with higher freezing levels over the upcoming weekend.</p>"
