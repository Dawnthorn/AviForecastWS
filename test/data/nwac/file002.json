  "detailed_forecast_day1": "<p>A strong upper level ridge is forecast to rebuild over the area Tuesday  and Tuesday night with generally clear skies and light winds with some  clouds trapped along the lower slopes. Solar insolation on mainly S thru SW  aspects and a warming trend will likely produce some melting in the near surface snow and a  few wet loose sluffs on steeper terrain. Sun crusts will likely form Tuesday night on any sun affected  terrain. Strong temperature inversions should be seen Tuesday for the areas  near the Cascade passes as cool and breezy easterly surface flow increases in the afternoon. This broad area of high  pressure should have little impact on the overall stability  trend of slow snowpack settlement and gradually increasing  stability.</p>\r\n<p>Recent stability tests (see snowpack  discussion) show that there are  still instabilities in the upper part of  the snowpack with generally  moderate to poor shear qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Remember, a moderate danger means  that small avalanches are still considered possible in specific areas.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Concerns:</strong> Pockets of shallow soft slabs on steeper   mainly  shaded terrain, and older wind slab on higher terrain located on  a  variety of aspects will continue  to slowly stabilize.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

  "snowpack_analysis": "<p>Beginning around Christmas, a strong split flow developed and provided a break from the stormy start to the season. Generally light amounts of new snow were received during and immediately following Christmas with little or no snow since then, including the weak frontal system from the 31st.&nbsp; Cool temperatures have helped to preserve good snow, especially on more shaded aspects.</p>\r\n<p>This pattern has also allowed for continued settlement and stabilization of the snowpack following the very active weather pattern seen earlier this month.&nbsp; About 5-10 feet of snowfall was received mid December to Christmas west of the crest, with lesser amounts on the east side during the active pattern along with strong and shifting winds; mainly from southeast thru westerly.&nbsp; The significant avalanche cycles (both natural and human triggered) during this period due to wind and rapid loading have abated. Most avalanches remained in new snow layers producing predominately soft slab releases and/or sluffs from very steep terrain. Some avalanches stepped to temporary hoar frost or a thin rain crust formed prior to the storms.</p>\r\n<p>The snowpack has settled around 6\" for most locations post-Christmas, except locally to near a foot near Paradise.</p>\r\n<p>Reports of sun crusts affecting south and west facing slopes have been cropping up from numerous backcountry trip reports from all over the Cascades.</p>\r\n<p>Recent reports close to Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes still mention some soft slab instabilities in the top foot or so of the snow with moderate to poor shear qualities.&nbsp; Due to the recent stabilizing trend, no new reports of instability have been received from ski areas. Last Friday, east of Stevens Pass at about the 3200 ft level, the WSDOT avalanche  control crew were able to find a lower density layer that collapsed  during compression tests around 2 1/2 ft down and easily propagated  during a propagation saw test.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The late November hoar frost layers in the vicinity of Washington Pass are still reported in the snowpack but are not reactive to tests and no slides have been initiated or involved on this layer in the recent past.&nbsp; Professionals skiing in the Hairpin Valley have not been able to find the mid-Dec surface hoar layer and reported good and stable skiing conditions over the past week. The lack of stability test results and continued stabilization over time continue to make these layers less of a concern. Still, continue to track this layer and exercise caution over thinner portions of the snowpack where the layer could be more easily triggered.</p>\r\n<p>Recent backcountry reports continue to indicated excellent snow conditions are still available without exposing oneself to unnecessary risk.</p>"
