<p><strong>Tuckerman and Huntington Ravines will have CONSIDERABLE avalanche danger today.</strong> Natural avalanches are possible and human-triggered avalanches will be likely. Dangerous avalanche conditions exist requiring careful snowpack evaluation, cautious route finding and conservative decision making. The only exceptions to this are the Lower Snowfields and the Little Headwall. The Lower Snowfields have Moderate avalanche danger. Natural avalanches are unlikely and human triggered avalanches are possible. The Little Headwall has Low avalanche danger where natural and human triggered avalanches are unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>AVALANCHE PROBLEM</strong>: Wind slabs that have developed over the past 48 hours and new winds slabs that will develop today are the primary threat. High winds over the past couple of days have created pencil (P) hard wind slabs in exposed locations and 4 finger (4F) hard wind slabs in protected lee locales. Today, winds will moderate and load in softer wind slabs from some snow last night, but mostly later today as the storm begins. This event is expected to deliver up to 4” (10cm) by around 7 pm at higher elevations. Defining the avalanche problem as “Wind Slab” is mainly to assist you in mitigating the threat using certain travel practices. One conundrum today is the lack of visibility which makes the “Considerable” recommendation of “cautious route finding” very difficult. You will not be able to see the terrain above you or if there are others in higher terrain out of view. This issue makes “conservative decision making” absolutely essential.</p>
<p><strong>WEATHER</strong>: Monday through Thursday the summit collected about 10” (25cm) of snow. In the past 24 hours another 2.5” (6cm) has fallen and we suspect another 2-4” (5-10cm) will fall today as a slow lingering storm begins to effect the region. The NWS has issued a Winter Storm Watch, forecasted to bring 10-14” (25-35cm) from now until Monday night. Expect light to moderate snowfall rates to keep avalanche danger elevated over the next several days. Early this morning wind gusts peaked into the 90’s mph (145’s kph) and have slackened to 65-70mph (104-112 kph) as expected. This trend will continue, falling as low as 40mph (68kph) by late this afternoon. Today temperatures will stay nippy at about -5F and rising slightly overnight.</p>
<p><strong>SNOWPACK</strong>: Hard wind slabs exist in most locations, with some locales holding softer 4 finger snow as of yesterday afternoon. We expect that the additional snow overnight, associated with high winds, kept these conditions similar this morning. We are starting the day with Moderate danger is most locations. This will change through the day as storm snow moves into the mountains and wind velocities fall to ideal loading speeds between 40-60 mph (64-96 kph) from the W. Expect an increasing avalanche danger in the Ravines, moving to Considerable as new snow accumulates. Slopes and gullies with an E, SE, and NE facing direction will pick up the most new wind slab in the deposition. Some examples include Tuckerman’s Sluice, Lip, Center Bowl, and Chute as well as Huntington’s Central, Pinnacle and Odell gullies. Areas facing N and S will get crossloaded and will be slower to reach the Considerable rating. These locations may struggle to get there before dark, but it all depends on the exact timing of snow and accumulations. The Winter Lion Head route is open and the John Sherburne ski trail is improving daily. We are expecting a busy weekend on the mountain so be prepared to lend a hand to others and watch out for those below you.</p>
<p><strong>Please Remember: </strong></p>
<p>• Safe travel in avalanche terrain requires training and experience. This advisory is just one tool to help you make your own decisions in avalanche terrain. You control your own risk by choosing where, when, and how you travel.</p>
<p>• Anticipate a changing avalanche danger when actual weather differs from the higher summits forecast.</p>
<p>• For more information contact the Forest Service Snow Rangers, the AMC at the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, or the caretakers at Hermit Lake Shelters or the Harvard Cabin.</p>
<p>• Posted 8:25a.m. Saturday, February 07, 2015. A new advisory will be issued tomorrow.</p>
