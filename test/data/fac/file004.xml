				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog will be an area where the Flathead Avalanche Center avalanche specialists (and other avalanche experts) discuss a certain topic in detail. This blog will allow us to expand upon certain concepts or topics related to avalanches such as backcountry travel, search and rescue, decision-making, and many others. You will find information here that we just can&#8217;t quite fit into the advisories, but is still very relevant and important. There is no set schedule for blog posts, but we will try to have a new topic/post just enough to keep in interesting.  It depends on how much it snows!</p>
<p>So, continue to check back, and if you have any topics that you&#8217;d like to see discussed in this space, email us at fac.admin@flatheadavalanche.org.  </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Issued: Dec. 17, 2013, 7:00 a.m. by Jon Jeresek<br />Expires: 11:59 p.m. of issue date</p>
<p>This advisory applies only to backcountry areas outside established ski area boundaries. The next scheduled advisory for the Kootenai National Forest area will be Friday, December 20, 2013. </p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: #ffffff; font-size: x-large;">MOUNTAIN WEATHER</span><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;"> </span></strong></p>
<p>Since the Friday (December 13th) advisory, only light amounts of snow (0.2”- 0.5” SWE) have fallen at  Kootenai area snotel sites (Banfield Mtn, Bear Mtn, Hawkins Lake, Poorman Cr).  Temperatures have risen from the mid-20s to above freezing for daytime highs.  Skies have been mostly overcast. Sunday and Monday brought lots of wind out of the southwest.   However, only snow at or above 6,500’ was available for wind transport.</p>
<p>FORECAST:  Mostly cloudy skies through Thursday.  Temperatures will remain above freezing Tuesday then slide to the teens for highs on Thursday.  Winds will be out of the southwest at 9-13 mph Tuesday- Wednesday, then switch to light southeast winds Thursday.  Significant wind transport is not expected.  Chance of snow is 30-80% Tuesday PM through Wednesday, with accumulations of 4-6” possible.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: #ffffff; font-size: x-large; color: #000000;">RECENT OBSERVATIONS</span></p>
<p>We traveled to the Cabinet Divide South in the East Cabinet Range on December 16th.  With the cessation of big game hunting seasons, folks are starting to venture into the back country.  35” to 45” of snow was encountered on east aspects at 6,000’ elevation.  Prominent knife hard crusts within the snowpack overlay soft (4 finger) layers.  Significant temperature gradients have diminished with the above freezing temperatures Saturday PM through Monday AM .  Column failures were EASY above the November 19<sup>th</sup> rain crust and yielded clean shears.  These Quality 1 and 2 shears were associated with angular plates and blocks.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-large;">SNOWPACK DISCUSSION</span></span></p>
<p>Buried crusts have weakened with the rise in temperatures from mid twenties to above freezing this week.  They support cautious snowmobile traffic, but NOT boot travel, and only intermittent ski travel.  With this loss of strength, collapse and shear failure should be expected by backcountry travelers.   All of our buried crusts overlay soft (4 finger) snow layers.  These are the sites of our easy to moderate column failures. At upper elevations, Sunday’s snowfall settled under above freezing temperatures to form a 5” soft (4 finger) slab.  It sits on a thin ice lens that releases very easily.  Likely, we will be dealing with this layer in the future.  </p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-large;"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">BOTTOM LINE</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">Overall, the avalanche hazard in the West Cabinets, East Cabinets and Purcell Ranges is <span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><b>MODERATE</b></span>.  This means that heightened avalanche conditions exist on specific terrain features, such as steep unanchored slopes above 5,500’.  Natural avalanches are unlikely, however human triggered avalanches are possible.  Backcountry travelers should evaluate snow and terrain carefully, and identify features of concern.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Picnic Notch Avalanche Incident Report<br /></b><b>Noisy Basin, Swan Range, MT<br /></b><b>Date of Avalanche: 14 December 2013<br /></b><b>Date of Investigation: 15 December 2013</b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INCIDENT SYNOPSIS</span></b><b> <br /></b>On Saturday, December 14, 2013, a party of two skiers was traveling in the Noisy Basin area near Camp Misery in the Swan Range, MT. Around noon, both skiers were ascending a slope they had previously descended. The skier in front (a 34 year old male) triggered an avalanche that released about 20 feet above him. He was caught in the avalanche and was carried to a tree where he came to rest fully buried except for one arm. He was able to extricate himself with this free arm and sustained no injuries. The avalanche occurred on a southwest facing slope that wraps around to more of a northwesterly aspect. A small sub-ridge bisects the slope causing cross loading of wind transported snow. The average slope angle of the starting zone was 39 degrees. The crown face depth averaged 12 inches with a maximum crown depth of 20 inches. The avalanche was approximately 250 feet wide and ran approximately 200 vertical feet. The crown was located at approximately 6700 feet in elevation and the toe of the debris was around 6620 feet. The caught skier was carried approximately 50 vertical feet. The United States classification of the avalanche is SS-ASu-R4-D2-I (Greene et al. , 2010).</p>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WEATHER AND SNOWPACK<br /></span></b>Weather data are from the Noisy Basin SNOTEL site (48.15˚N, 113.95˚W; 6040 ft.). Total Snow Water Equivalence (SWE) for this site was hovering around 140% of the 30-year median value. This station is located approximately 0.5 miles southwest of the incident site.</p>
<p align="left">Beginning on Tuesday, December 10, 2013, an entrenched arctic air mass started moving east and a more westerly flow brought more seasonal temperatures (19-32 °F for Kalispell). During that arctic outbreak mountain temperatures reached below -20 °F. As the air mass moved east, a storm on December 9-10 deposited fairly low density (&lt;10%) snow to the region. Snowfall amounts at Noisy Basin totaled about 16-20 inches (40-50 cm) with about 0.9 inches (22 mm) of snow water equivalent (SWE) (Figure 1). Since December 10, snowfall tapered and predominantly southwest winds increased on December 13 around the region. On December 14, a few inches accumulated throughout the day.</p>

<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Avalanche activity (both natural and human triggered) was noted in the region from the onset of the storm on December 11 with a few reports until Thursday, December 12. Observations on the morning of December 14 by FAC staff in nearby Peters Ridge, Swan Range, noted no obvious signs of instability and no recent avalanche activity. The same was noted in the northern Flathead Range, but FAC staff observed substantial winds, wind loading, and “thick” wind slabs forming on leeward slopes. These slabs were not as “sensitive” in this location as expected.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">FAC staff received a report of a skier triggered avalanche on the evening of Saturday, December 14, 2013. Staff spoke with the reporting party and received detailed information regarding the location and events. FAC staff visited the incident site on Sunday, December 15 (the day after the accident), and completed a fracture line profile on a southwest aspect and found a wind slab consisting of a variety of snow layers sitting on a layer of small faceted crystals over a 0.8 inch (2 cm) thick melt-freeze crust (from the warm, sunny period of late November) (Figure 2). </p>

<p align="left"> Figure 2: Crown profile of the avalanche with failure layer denoted.</p>
<p align="left">The bed surface of the avalanche was the melt-freeze crust at 12 inches (140 cm) below the surface. Above this crust was a cohesive wind slab ranging in depth from 12 inches (30 cm) to 20 inches (50 cm) across the crown. We were able to safely access the northern half of the crown, but a chute above the remainder of the crown that had not released posed a safety concern. FAC staff noted that the portion of the crown where the avalanche was triggered was much shallower and unsupportable. Ski penetration in this localized area was nearly to the ground.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Stability test results on the crown were mixed. The Extended Column Tests (ECTs) performed on the crown had no results (ECTX x2). Compression tests failed on the small facets with hard force (CTH 23, Q3). We noted cross loading from southwest winds while on site. The day of the investigation we did not see any new avalanche activity aside from the avalanche investigated nor did we experience cracking or collapsing of the snowpack along our ascent or descent. Other folks recreating in the area also mentioned that they had not seen any other avalanche activity that day.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">We noticed that based on the reporting party’s description the avalanche was triggered from the skier’s right side (northern part) of the crown (Figure 3-5). The area where the avalanche was triggered was shallow relative to the rest of avalanche area. Thus, given this information it is probable that the skier initiated a fracture on a weak layer in this shallow area and the fracture propagated along a weak layer underneath a wind slab through the remainder of the slope. The debris ran through and over a small trap (small depression) at the bottom of the slope and continued a bit further downslope. The total snow depth at the crown was 78 inches (199 cm), and the measured debris was about 3 feet deep. The total snow depth in the deposition zone (debris plus existing snowpack was 116 inches (295cm). The avalanche ran approximately 200 vertical feet and about 400 linear feet.</p>

<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AVALANCHE<br /></span></b>The Flathead Avalanche Center avalanche advisory for December 14 read:</p>
<p align="left">“The avalanche hazard is CONSIDERABLE on wind loaded slopes steeper than 30 degrees. The hazard is MODERATE on all other slopes. This means that human triggered avalanches are likely on steep slopes with sensitive wind slabs and possible on other slopes where facets and surface hoar still exist about 1-2 feet below the surface.</p>
<p align="left"> The skier who triggered the avalanche provided valuable information regarding the accident site and all of the events of the day of the incident. Skier A (34 year old male) and Skier B (34 year old female) approached Noisy Basin along the Jewel Basin Rd. via snowmobile and parked at Camp Misery (Figure 6 and Figure 7). They checked the avalanche advisory before departing in the morning, and they each carried a beacon, shovel, and probe. They consider themselves expert skiers with about 14 years of backcountry skiing experience, and had taken “a couple” of Level 1 avalanche courses throughout the years.</p>

<p align="left">During the morning, they headed toward Picnic Notch, ascended to the notch, and safely skied just skier’s left (south) of their uptrack. They then transitioned from downhill to uphill travel mode and began their second ascent toward Picnic Notch. They made progress up the slope via a series of switchbacks. Skier A then decided to go a bit further south to access an area with more potential vertical feet of skiing. This area is beneath a rocky section just south of Picnic Notch. As he continued upward in a southerly direction, he felt the snowpack consistency change and it “felt weird”. He then advised his partner to remain in her location. He took a few more strides and began to notice localized cracking of the snow. Just after this, he looked up to see the slope above him about 20 feet begin to avalanche. Still in uphill travel mode, his skis were not attached to his heels and his climbing risers on his bindings were still in an upright position. He immediately notified his partner that the slope was sliding and tried to put his climbing risers down to become more stable on his feet. He was instantly swept off his feet by the moving snow and transported down the slope in the debris. He made swimming motions and tried to spring out of the moving snow. He eventually hit a tree and remained in the “eddy” of the tree while debris moved around and over him. He became buried with only an arm sticking out of the snow. He mentioned that his mouth was full of snow at this time. He was able to brush the debris away using his arm and eventually free his head and airway. He was able to remove himself entirely from the debris. After assessing for injuries (of which there were none), he and his partner descended and debriefed the situation.</p>
<p align="left"> Skier A mentioned a few points that are common in avalanche incidents and highlight the “human factor”.</p>
<ul>
<li>He mentioned that on this day they did not dig a pit. He acknowledged that they typically dig snowpits in this area and in the past noticed the variability across the slope due to crossloading (i.e. shallow on one side and deep on the other).</li>
<li>He acknowledged that he and his partner on this day succumbed to the familiarity notion suggesting that the slope is safe after being safely descended nearby once earlier in the day. From many avalanche accidents, we know that it isn’t just the first person (or first time on the slope that day) that triggers the avalanche.</li>
<li>He also discussed that they had “let their guard down” after skiing the slope the first time, and they were headed back up for just one more run before departing.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">We appreciate Skier A speaking with us and sharing the details of the event so that they may be used to inform and educate others.</p>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SEARCH AND RESCUE<br /></span></b>No search and rescue operations were initiated as the caught skier was able to extricate himself and was uninjured.</p>

<p>Previous post:<br />12/15/2013<br />Update to skier triggered avalanche in Swan Range on 12/14/2013.</p>
<p>A skier triggered avalanche was reported to the Flathead Avalanche Center (FAC) Saturday evening (12/14). FAC staff was able to speak with the skier who triggered the avalanche and was subsequently caught in the avalanche that evening.  The location was just skier&#8217;s left (south) of Picnic Notch and north of Crown Bowl in the Swan Range. The skier triggered the avalanche while ascending the slope after previously descending the slope. There were two members of the party and only one was caught.  The skier was caught and carried approximately 200 vertical feet downslope where he came to rest near a tree, fully buried with just one arm sticking out of the debris.  He was able to extricate himself using his free arm and was uninjured. </p>
<p>FAC staff investigated the avalanche site today (12/15). The crown depth of the avalanche averaged approximately 12 inches and the maximum was 16-18 inches. The flanks were difficult to see due to overnight wind loading, but the width of the crown was estimated at approximately 200 feet. Debris ran approximately 500 vertical feet. It appears that the avalanche was triggered in a shallow part of the slope near rocks and propagated along a layer of small facets underneath a wind slab.</p>
<p>The avalanche was preliminarily classified as SS-AS-R4-D2-I. This was a soft slab avalanche unintentionally triggered by a skier. </p>
<p>A full incident report will be published tomorrow (12/16/2013) on the FAC website.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: #3366ff;">THIS ADVISORY HAS EXPIRED</span></p>
<p>Issued: Dec. 15, 2013, 7:00 a.m.<br />Expires: 11:59 p.m. of issue date</p>
<p>Good morning! This is Seth Carbonari with the Flathead Avalanche Center avalanche advisory for Sunday, December 15, 2013. This advisory applies only to backcountry areas outside established ski area boundaries. The next scheduled advisory will be Wednesday, December 18, 2013.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: #ffffff; font-size: x-large;">MOUNTAIN WEATHER</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WeatherGraphic.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3335 alignleft" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" alt="WeatherGraphic" src="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WeatherGraphic.jpg" width="171" height="87" /></a></p>
<p>Temperatures warmed through the week, approached the freezing mark in many areas on Saturday and are still just below freezing at higher elevations. Winds also have been on the increase as some sensors at higher elevations are reporting gusts in excess of 70 mph this morning. Snow showers were light in the mountains Saturday with snow water equivalents measuring 0.4” at both Flattop and Noisy Basin SNOTEL sites. Temperatures should stay on the warm side for Sunday into the first part of the week with small gains in precipitation.  The National Weather Service is predicting strong West to Southwest winds for Sunday with the possibility of 40 to 50 mph gusts above 6000&#8242;.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: #ffffff; font-size: x-large; color: #000000;">RECENT OBSERVATIONS</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RecentObservationsGraphic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3334 alignleft" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" alt="RecentObservationsGraphic" src="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RecentObservationsGraphic.jpg" width="171" height="87" /></a></p>
<p>On Saturday, Erich was in the Paola Ridge area in the Middle Fork and I was in the Peter&#8217;s Ridge area in the Swan Range (<a title="12/14/13 Peter's Ridge Snow Profile" href="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/category/snow_profiles/" target="_blank">snow profile</a>). No recent avalanche activity or signs of instability were noted at either location, but visibility was challenging.  Snow was being steadily transported above 5000’.  Stability tests at Peter&#8217;s Ridge and on North aspects in Paola creek produced little results.  On the South aspect in Paola Creek, repeated extended column tests propagated across the column with moderate force (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9vmOuITgsU" target="_blank">video</a>).  This problem layer has persisted and continues to gain loading on top of it.  We also received a report from Penrose Ridge in the Middle Fork with similar observations on north aspects.</p>
<p>A skier triggered an avalanche and was caught and fully buried except for one arm near Picnic Notch in Noisy Basin on Saturday.  The skier was able to self-rescue without any injuries.  The skier estimated the avalanche to have a crown of 2 feet, stretch 200 to 300 feet across the slope and run approximately 200 feet vertical.  We hope to visit the site Sunday and will provide additional information as we are able.  This incident is a great reminder that while some aspects and locations are exhibiting few signs of instability, others can be very sensitive.     </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; background-color: #ffffff;">Avalanche Problem #1</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/2013/12/avalanche-advisory-1272013/windslab-2/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3459"><img class="size-full wp-image-3459 alignleft" alt="Wind Slab" src="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WindSlab1.jpg" width="96" height="151" /></a></p>
<p>Strong winds and consistent snowfall during the past week have developed substantial wind slabs within the advisory area. The formation of wind slabs from previous days also exists within the underlying cold snow pack. These wind slabs sit on multiple weak faceted layers. Some of these weak layers are buried deep in the snowpack and may be difficult to trigger but the potential exists that even a small wind slab could subsequently trigger an avalanche in these deeper layers.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; background-color: #ffffff;">Avalanche Problem #2</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/?attachment_id=3465" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3465"><img class="size-full wp-image-3465 alignleft" alt="Persistent Slab" src="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PersistentSlab.jpg" width="96" height="152" /></a>Observations and stability tests still reveal persistent<br />weak layers such as surface hoar and facets buried 2&#8242; deep in the snowpack (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9vmOuITgsU" target="_blank">video</a>). The additional loading will add stress to these layers. Continue to carefully evaluate these layers prior to skiing or riding a slope. This weak layer is not to be trusted. The only way to know if this layers exists and how reactive it might be is to dig down and check it out. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">BOTTOM LINE</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">For today, the avalanche hazard is <span style="background-color: #ff6600;"><b>CONSIDERABLE<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> on wind loaded slopes steeper than 30 degrees. The hazard is <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">MODERATE<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> on all other slopes.

<p>This week saw a gradual increase in temperature and strong winds at elevation, this trend should continue through the weekend. We have been consistently getting light snow showers since Wednesday morning, snow water equivalents since the last advisory are measuring 0.9” at both Flattop and Noisy Basin SNOTEL sites. Currently, remote weather stations are reading 22 to 30 °F with winds out of the southwest at 15-25 mph and gusts up to 52mph. Expect temperatures to continue to rise with gusty southwest winds and light snow showers through the weekend.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RecentObservationsGraphic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3334 alignleft" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" alt="RecentObservationsGraphic" src="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RecentObservationsGraphic.jpg" width="171" height="87" /></a></p>
<p>We visited the Pinnacle Creek drainage yesterday in the Middle Fork of the northern Flathead Range. Decent<br />visibility revealed no sign of recent avalanche activity, we did not experience<br />any immediate signs of instability such as cracking or collapsing. We observed several natural cornice failures on east slopes that did not trigger<br />avalanches. Snow was being steadily transported above 5000’. Don&#8217;t get lulled into a false sense of security when there are no &#8220;bulls-eye&#8221; signs observed. There are lingering wind slabs and hard slabs that cannot be trusted. Observations from skiers earlier in the week in  the Canyon Creek area in the Whitefish Range reported stable results, but other skiers also reported isolated collapsing near Skookoleel. BNSF avalanche safety also reported unstable results in stability test as well as cornice fall that triggered an avalanche (<a title="Observation 12/12/2013 John F. Stevens Canyon" href="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/2013/12/observation-12122013-john-f-stevens-canyon/">observation</a>). Finally, skiers on Little Shield in the southern part of Glacier Park reported fresh wind slab formation with yesterday&#8217;s winds and otherwise saw no obvious signs of instability. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; background-color: #ffffff;">Avalanche Problem #1</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/2013/12/avalanche-advisory-1272013/windslab-2/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3459"><img class="size-full wp-image-3459 alignleft" alt="Wind Slab" src="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WindSlab1.jpg" width="96" height="151" /></a></p>
<p>Strong winds and consistent snowfall during the past week have developed substantial wind slabs with in the advisory area. The formation of wind slabs from previous days also exists within the underlying cold snow pack. These wind slabs sit on multiple weak faceted layers. Some of these weak layers are buried deep in the snowpack and may be difficult to trigger but the potential exists that even a small wind slab could subsequently trigger an avalanche in these deeper layers. This brings us to our next avalanche problem.</p>

<p> <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; background-color: #ffffff;">Avalanche Problem #2</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/?attachment_id=3465" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3465"><img class="size-full wp-image-3465 alignleft" alt="Persistent Slab" src="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PersistentSlab.jpg" width="96" height="152" /></a>Observations and stability tests still reveal persistent<br />weak layers such as surface hoar and facets buried 1-2&#8242; deep in the snow pack. The additional loading will add stress to these layers. Continue to carefully evaluate these layers prior to skiing or riding a slope.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-large;"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">BOTTOM LINE</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">For today, the avalanche hazard is <span style="background-color: #ff6600;"><b>CONSIDERABLE<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> on wind loaded slopes steeper than 30 degrees. The hazard is <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">MODERATE<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> on all other slopes. T</span></span></span></b></span>his means that human triggered avalanches are likely on steep slopes with sensitive wind slabs and possible on other slopes where facets and surface hoar still exist about 1-2 feet below the surface.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/2013/12/fac-public-observer-network/greatergranite_debris_0505/" rel="attachment wp-att-3774"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3774 alignleft" alt="GreaterGraniteDebris" src="http://www.flatheadavalanche.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GreaterGranite_debris_0505-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>We need your help!</p>
<p>The Flathead Avalanche Center (FAC) is currently organizing a volunteer observer network into the FAC advisory program.  This observer network is being incorporated into the FAC advisory program to assist forecasters with additional objective based field data related to avalanche, snowpack, and weather.  This additional data will improve advisory accuracy and allow for observer-based observations to be posted between advisory issuance as observers will be able to post objective field observations  on the FAC website.</p>
<p>The need for this observation network is based on the fact that the FAC advisory provides an avalanche forecast that covers a large geographic area, and objective accuracy of the FAC advisory is dependent on the amount  of data available from different locations within the advisory area.  Simply, the more data available to FAC avalanche specialists, the more accurately the FAC advisory will represent conditions.</p>
<p>To be a volunteer observer within this network you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect field data to standards represented in the <em>Snow, Weather, and Avalanches Observational Guidelines for Avalanche Programs in the United States</em>.</li>
<li>Have completed at least a Level One (1) American avalanche course before becoming an observer.</li>
<li>Attend a motorized or non-motorized FAC Observer Course. A non-motorized course will take place on January 4, 2014 and a motorized course on January 11, 2014.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those that complete the field training and submit observations through the season will have their observations posted on the FAC website. We certainly still want ALL observations from anyone. So, if you are not interested in this network, but still want to submit observations, then please continue to submit your observations. We welcome this information and they will be incorporated into our advisory and decision making. However, these observations will not be posted as separate observations on the FAC website. So, if you want them posted, then consider taking this course. This allows us to provide objective informatiDates and Locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Field days (January 4<sup style="color: #000000; font-style: normal;">th</sup> and 11<sup style="color: #000000; font-style: normal;">th</sup>) will be at <b style="color: #000000; font-style: normal;">Whitefish Mountain Resort (WMR) for non-motorized course and Canyon Creek Winter Trailhead for motorized course.</b> </li>
<li>For the January 4<sup>th</sup> <b>non-motorized</b> field day, we will meet at the Buffalo Café in Whitefish at 0700 before heading to WMR.</li>
<li>For the January 11<sup>th </sup><b>motorized</b> field day, we will be meeting at 0800 at the Nite Owl in Columbia Falls before heading over to Canyon Creek. Course space is limited to 15 participants for each group.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on the FAC observer’s course or if you cannot make either of these courses and would like to attend, please contact the Flathead Avalanche Center at: (406) 261-9873. To register, please email <a href="mailto:fac.admin@flatheadavalanche.org">fac.admin@flatheadavalanche.org</a> with the subject line “Observer Network”. Again, the course is limited to 15 participants.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in helping provide avalanche information and education for our community.</p>
