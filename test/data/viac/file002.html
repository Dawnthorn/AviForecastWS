<p class="Body"><strong>Confidence: </strong>Good.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p class="Body"><strong></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Main Concerns:</strong> (Avalanche problems)</span></p>
<p><strong>Wind Slab</strong> - Wind slabs dating from the storm Friday and found on NW to E aspects may remain triggerable by humans on Monday. More recent slabs created&nbsp; by strong NW winds on Saturday and found on southerly aspects are more touchy to human triggers. New slabs will be formed on NW to NE aspects on Tuesday/Wednesday with new snow and wind in the coming system. These will certainly be triggerable by human loads and may even fail naturally. All of these wind slabs are a problem that will be found at tree line and in the alpine and will produce avalanches from small to large enough to bury, injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Storm Slab - </strong>New snow forecast for Tuesday Wednesday may come in sufficient quantity (especially on the west coast) to make for instability in the storm snow at all elevations and on all aspects. These could produce avalanches from small to large enough to bury, injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong></p>
<p>The island Alps received 60 to 80cm of snow from Friday to Sunday with the bulk of it coming on Friday. Winds were strong from the SE to SW during the precipitation and then shifted to strong from the NW on Saturday. Freezing levels were around 1300m at the start of precipitation on Friday but then dropped much lower giving low density snow from 1000m up. The outlook is as 
follows:</p>
<p><strong>Monday: </strong>High overcast and increasing cloud during the day. No new precipitation. Light SW winds. Freezing level around 600m.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> 20 to 30cm of snow starting later in the day. Winds increasing to moderate to strong SE. Freezing level around 500m.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong>: 10 to 20cm of snow. Winds easing to light to moderate from the SE to SW. Freezing level around 500m.</p>
<p><strong>Snow Pack:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">60 to 80cm of new snow has been moved first by strong SE to SW winds on Friday and then by strong NW winds on Saturday to produce winds slabs at tree line and above. Surfaces in wind exposed areas vary from very stiff slabs to exposed melt freeze crust at tree line and below. The older slabs are of course less reactive now but those formed on Saturday remain somewhat reactive on Monday and new slabs which will be formed on Tuesday/Wednesday will be quite touchy to human loads. Snow surfaces on sunny aspects became moist on Sunday whereas on shady aspects small surface hoar was forming. Persistent instabilities mentioned in our previous bulletin </span><span style="font-size: small;">have 'tightened up" considerably and would likely only react with a very big load in very specific terrain (alpine, shallow snow pack, shady).&nbsp; The lower snowpack is strong and
 well consolidated.<br /></span></p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Avalanche Activity:</strong></p>
<p class="Body">Natural and skier triggered avalanches to size two were observed on Friday and skier triggered avalanches to size two were observed on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Advisory:</strong></p>
<p>Enter the wind zone at tree line and above with caution on Monday and early Tuesday and be aware that the freshest wind slabs are on southerly aspects. Note that hazard will increase as the storm intensifies on Tuesday/Wednesday and avoid avalanche terrain in these times of loading from new snow and wind. Watch for signs of instability such as cracking and wumphing.</p>

<p class="Body"><strong>Confidence: </strong>Fair to Good. Confidence in the weather predictions is quite good though there is some uncertainty about exact precipitation amounts and freezing levels.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p class="Body"><strong></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Main Concerns:</strong> (Avalanche problems)</span></p>
<p><strong>Wind Slab</strong> - New wind slabs have formed and continue to form on NW through to NE aspects, and in cross loaded features at tree line and in the alpine. When the wind shifts on Saturday new slabs will be formed on S to E aspects. These wind slabs will likely 
fail naturally and be easily triggerable by
 humans and will produce avalanches from small to big enough to bury, 
injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Storm Slab - </strong>Significant amounts of new snow are making for unstable new snow on all aspects 
and at all elevations. These storm slabs will likely fail naturally and 
be easily triggerable by humans and will produce avalanches from small 
to big enough to bury, injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Slab -</strong>&nbsp; Significant&nbsp; load from new snow will be 
loading weak layers buried in the snow pack found on shady (NE to NW) aspects at 
all elevations. These vary 
from buried surface hoar found in shady areas sheltered from wind at 
tree line and below, to buried surface facets and weak crusts on shady 
aspects in the alpine. While these weaknesses are now more difficult to 
trigger than they were last week end (see incident reports) it is still 
possible for a larger trigger, such as an avalanche in storm layers "stepping down", a cornice fall or perhaps even a heavier human load such as a 
snow mobile, to activate these layers and cause avalanches larger than what is required to bury injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong></p>
<p>From early Wednesday until early Friday the island mountains had received between 15 and 50cm of new snow (highest amounts on the west coast, medium on the north island and least on the east coast). The freezing level climbed on a couple of occasions bringing the rain line up to about 1200m with light rain to that elevation on Wednesday and heavier rain on Friday morning on parts of the island. Winds were strong enough to move snow and came from SW to SE during the precipitation. The outlook is as 
follows:</p>
<p><strong>Friday: </strong>Precipitation continuing bringing 35 to 55cm of additional snow. Freezing levels climbing to between 1000 and 1300m. Winds moderate to strong SW to SE.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong> Light snow (3-5cm) except perhaps locally heavier over the north island (up to 20cm). Freezing level 600-800m. Winds moderate to strong NW.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong>: A trace of snow still possible in some areas but generally clearing skies. Freezing level between surface and 400m. Winds light N and NE.</p>
<p><strong>Snow Pack:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">15 to 50cm of new snow sits on a variety of surfaces from crusts of varying thicknesses below tree line and at tree line to previous storm snow in the alpine. </span>Wind slabs have been formed in the alpine and at tree line by winds from the south east through west to north west.<span style="font-size: small;">
 At various depths (depending on snow pack depths on different parts of 
the island as well as specific location with relation to wind loading) 
crusts with facets and surface hoar sitting on them exist on shady 
aspects. These layers were the failure plane of numerous natural and 
skier triggered avalanches across the island last week end. At tree line 
and below with the snow having become warm and then cooled again, these 
layers will be very difficult to trigger but we expect that a larger 
trigger (</span>an avalanche in storm layers "stepping down", a cornice fall or perhaps even a heavier human load such as a 
snow mobile)<span style="font-size: small;"> could still activate them even at these elevations. In the alpine 
these layers could be more reactive. The lower snowpack is strong and
 well consolidated.<br /></span></p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Avalanche Activity:</strong></p>
<p class="Body">No new activity has yet been reported by time of writing (Friday morning) though we expect that a natural avalanche cycle is under way.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Advisory:</strong></p>
<p>Stay out of avalanche terrain on Friday. Stick to lower angled and well forested "Simple" terrain if you want to stay out of trouble. As the storm lets up remain aware that instabilities in new snow and new wind slabs will take several days to settle out and stabilize. On Saturday and Sunday avoid area of loading from wind including ridge tops, cross loaded features and gullies and note that the winds are shifting on Saturday to newly load slopes facing S to E, Cracks, shooting cracks, whumpfing sounds and avalanche activity in the last 48 hours are all strong indications of instability in the snow pack. Be aware that persistent 
instabilities buried deeper in the snowpack may be triggerable by 
heavy loads (which could include smaller avalanches "stepping own") and could produce larger avalanches with greater consequences.</p>

<p class="Body"><strong>Confidence: </strong>Fair. Timing and intensity of the system coming Thursday are uncertain<strong>. </strong>Hazard ratings above for Thursday are based on the assumption that the storm does not start until the evening. Watch the timing of this system and raise the hazard if the system delivers significant amounts (20-30cm) of snow earlier on Thursday.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p class="Body"><strong></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Main Concerns:</strong> (Avalanche problems)</span></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Wind Slab</strong> - New wind slabs have been formed in the alpine by winds from the south east through west to north west. With the system coming Thursday/Friday much more new snow and wind will form deeper winds slabs at tree line and in the alpine on all the same aspects as winds will come first from the south east to south west and later from the north west. These wind slabs will likely fail naturally or be easily triggerable by
 humans and will produce avalanches from small to big enough to bury, 
injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Storm Slab - </strong>Significant amounts of new snow with our<strong> </strong>next system Thursday/Friday will make for unstable new snow on all aspects and at all elevations. These storm slabs will likely fail naturally or be easily triggerable by humans and will produce avalanches from small to big enough to bury, injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Slab -</strong>&nbsp; New snow will be 
loading weak layers buried in the snow pack found on shady aspects at all elevations. These vary 
from buried surface hoar found in shady areas sheltered from wind at 
tree line and below to buried surface facets and weak crusts on shady 
aspects in the alpine. While these weaknesses are now more difficult to trigger than they were last week end (see incident reports) it is still possible for a larger trigger, such as a cornice fall or perhaps even a snow mobile, to activate these layers and cause larger avalanches.</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong></p>
<p>The Island Alps received between 5 and 30mm of precipitation since Monday 
(up to 30mm north and central island, 20mm west island and 5-10mm east island). Freezing levels went up to around tree line 
around mid day to mid afternoon on Tuesday. Winds with this system were
moderate to strong from the south east through west to north west.&nbsp;
 The outlook is as 
follows:</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday: </strong>Light snow fall (0-5cm). Moderate to strong winds from the north west. Freezing level 500-1000m.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> 10-20cm of snow starting late in the day. Moderate to strong winds from the south east to south west. Freezing level 500-1000m.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong>: The system from overnight Thursday continues bringing another 25-40cm of snow. Southerly winds lighten but then turn to the north west and rise again to moderate to strong. Freezing level 500-800m.</p>
<p><strong>Snow Pack:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Up to tree line the snow surface became moist on Tuesday and then froze again overnight, whereas in the alpine all our new precipitation this week has come as snow. </span>New wind slabs have been formed in the alpine by winds from the south east through west to north west.<span style="font-size: small;"> At various depths (depending on snow pack depths on different parts of the island as well as specific location with relation to wind loading) crusts with facets and surface hoar sitting on them exist on shady aspects.

At tree line and below with the snow having become warm and then cooled again, these layers will be more difficult to trigger but we expect that a larger trigger could still activate them at these elevations. In the alpine these layers could be more reactive. The lower snowpack is strong and
 well consolidated.<br /></span></p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Avalanche Activity:</strong></p>
<p class="Body">Only loose snow avalanches below tree line on steep, sunny terrain have been reported with the warming on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Advisory:</strong></p>
<p>Avoid avalanche terrain in times of significant loading from new snow and wind (Friday). Watch the approach of the next system on Thursday and be aware that the hazard ratings above are based on the assumption that the system does not reach us until Thursday evening. If it comes earlier raise the hazard. Avoid newly wind loaded areas at ridge tops, in cross loaded features and in gullies. Give cornices a wide berth whether traveling above or below them. Be aware the persistent instabilities buried deeper in the snowpack may be triggerable by heavier loads such as a cornice fall or perhaps even a snowmobile.</p>
