<p><strong>Main Concerns:</strong>&nbsp;(Avalanche problems)</p>
<p><strong>Wind Slab -&nbsp;</strong>New wind slabs have been formed in the alpine and at tree line on south and south east aspects and in cross loaded features by moderate north and north west winds. New wind slabs will be formed in the alpine and at tree line on north, north east and east aspects during our coming storm on Friday/Saturday. On Sunday north and north west winds will create more new wind slab in the alpine and at tree line again on south to south east aspects and in cross loaded features. These wind slabs will be triggerable by human loads and may fail naturally on Saturday in areas of higher precipitation. They will range in size from small to large enough to bury, injure or kill a person (size 1-2).</p>
<p><strong>Travel/Terrain Advice:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Carefully assess new snow amounts and the extend of wind effect as you head above tree line. Find small features with no consequence on which to test the reactivity of winds slab before committing to larger pieces of terrain. Be aware that in areas of higher precipitation natural avalanches may be a possibility on Saturday.</p>
<p>There is still not much snow in the Island Alps and it tapers off quickly as you lose elevation meaning that obstacles such as rocks and stumps are a real hazard.</p>
<p><strong>Past Weather:</strong></p>
<p>The Island Alps received just a trace of precipitation over the last couple of days with the exception of the north island which saw 5-10cm of snow depending on location. Winds were variable in direction but of note is a north wind up to moderate in strength which was transporting snow on the 24th and 25th. Temperatures varied with the terrain around the island with freezing levels averaging 500 to 1200m but with some cooler air trapped lower in places and above freezing air to near tree line in others.</p>
<p><strong>Avalanche Summary :</strong></p>
<p>No new avalanches have been observed.</p>
<p><strong>Snowpack &nbsp;Description:</strong></p>
<p>The island snowpack ranges from about 60cm to over double that at tree line depending on location (least on the north island). In the alpine, and at tree line new wind slabs have formed in the lees to north and north west winds and in cross loaded features. These sit on previous surfaces which include a rain crust at lower elevations and previous storm snow at higher elevations. The remainder of the snowpack consists of storm snow from the sudden onset of winter last week. Shears within that storm snow are are now rendering only hard results in tests at tree line.</p>
<p><strong>Weather Forecast:</strong></p>
<p>Friday - Mix of sun and cloud with cloud increasing later in the day and precipitation starting overnight. Winds rising to moderate to strong south west and freezing levels rising to as high as 1300m with the system.</p>
<p>Saturday - Cloudy with precipitation totalling 5 to 20mm by the end of the system (greatest amounts on the west and north island, least in the east). Winds up to strong SW shifting to moderate to strong NW after the system. FL dropping from a peak of about 1300m down to 1000m and below.</p>
<p>Sunday - Mostly sunny, winds moderate easing to light north west, temperatures cooling and freezing levels dropping through 500m to sea level.</p>

<p><strong>Main Concerns:</strong>&nbsp;(Avalanche problems)</p>
<p><strong>Wind Slab -&nbsp;</strong>Wind slabs formed during the last couple of days will remain triggerable to human loads. They will be found mostly on north west to north east aspects and in cross loaded features and could produce avalanches from small to large enough to bury, injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Travel/Terrain Advice:</strong></p>
<p>Be aware that wind slab formed over the last couple of days will likely remain reactive to human loads at tree line and in the alpine on Wednesday and for longer in the alpine. Carefully assess snow amounts and the extend of wind effect as you head above tree line and find small features with no consequence on which to test the reactivity of winds slab before committing to larger pieces of terrain.</p>
<p>There is still not much snow in the Island Alps and it tapers off quickly as you lose elevation meaning that obstacles such as rocks and stumps are a real hazard.</p>
<p><strong>Past Weather:</strong></p>
<p>The Island Alps received between a trace and more than 20mm of precipitation in the last 48 hours (greatest amounts on the north and west island). Freezing levels varied around the island making this snow above 1000m in most places but bringing rain to tree line in others. Winds were light gusting to moderate and variable in direction.</p>
<p><strong>Avalanche Summary :</strong></p>
<p><span>Skier triggered, small (size one) loose dry and soft slab avalanches have been observed.</span></p>
<p><strong>Snowpack &nbsp;Description:</strong></p>
<p>The island snowpack ranges from about 60cm to over double that at tree line depending on location (least on the north island). In the alpine, and to some extent at tree line depending on location and freezing levels during our last precipitation, &nbsp;5 to 25cm of new snow sits on top of previous surfaces which include a rain crust at lower elevations and previous storm snow higher elevations. Wind slab in the alpine, while becoming more stubborn, can likely still be triggered by human loads. The remainder of the snowpack consists of storm snow from the sudden onset of winter last week. Shears within that storm snow are tightening up now rendering only hard results in tests at tree line.</p>
<p><strong>Weather Forecast:</strong></p>
<p>Wednesday - Mix of sun and cloud, trace of precipitation, freezing level below 1000m, winds gusting to moderate SW.</p>
<p>Thursday - Mix of sun and cloud, no precipitation, freezing level below 1000m, winds lighte SW.</p>
<p>Friday - Cloud building and precipitation starting later in the day, freezing levels to 1200m, winds shifting from light NW to SW.</p>

<div class="content"><strong>Confidence:&nbsp;</strong>Fair. Field information for our forecasts remains very limited. Considerable for alpine for Tuesday is for areas of higher precipitation and/or stronger winds IF freezing levels remain low enough for snow to fall rather than rain.</div>

<p><strong>Main Concerns:</strong>&nbsp;(Avalanche problems)</p>
<p><strong>Wind Slab -&nbsp;</strong>Wind slabs formed during our last storms will remain reactive to human loads only in the alpine on Monday. They will be found on north west to north east aspects and in cross loaded features and could produce avalanches from small to large enough to bury, injure or kill a person. New wind slabs will form in the alpine on Tuesday in areas of high enough precipitation and/or strong enough winds IF freezing levels stay low enough to deliver snow rather than rain.</p>
<p><strong>Storm Slab -&nbsp;</strong>Storm slabs formed during our last storms will remain reactive to human loads only in the alpine on Monday. They will be found on all aspects and could produce avalanches from small to large enough to bury, injure or kill a person. New storm slabs will form in the alpine on Tuesday in areas of high enough precipitation (30cm +) IF freezing levels stay low enough to deliver snow rather than rain.</p>
<p><strong>Wet Loose Avalanches&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;- Rising freezing levels on Tuesday will bring rain to at least tree line if not higher. Wet snow avalanches will occur naturally and with human trigger on all aspects and at all elevations to which rain reaches. These avalanches will tend to be small point releases.</p>
<p><strong>Travel/Terrain Advice:</strong></p>
<p>If you get up to the alpine be aware that wind and storm slab formed over the weekend will likely remain reactive to human loads up there. Carefully assess snow amounts and the extend of wind effect as you head above tree line. Also find small features with no consequence on which to test the reactivity of storm and winds slab.</p>
<p>Remember that though small, loose wet avalanches can be heavy and "pushy" and can do harm when combined with terrain traps such as trees and cliffs. Watch freezing levels on Tuesday and recognize that rain will increase the loose wet snow avalanche likelihood.</p>
<p>The height of snow tapers down significantly below tree line meaning that obstacles such as rocks and stumps remain barely covered at lower elevations. Indeed even at tree line and in the alpine our snow has come all at once and has little base meaning that these obstacles can be hazards at all elevations.</p>
<p><strong>Current Weather:</strong></p>
<p>The Island Alps received between about 50mm and 120mm of water since Friday morning. Greater amounts on the west coast and in the centre of the island mountains, lesser amounts on the east coast and the least on the north island. Freezing levels spiked later on Saturday bringing rain to just above tree line in most places and higher on the west coast and in the centre of the island. The result is an estimated 35 to 80cm of snow at tree line depending on location and significantly more in the alpine. Winds were moderate to strong from south east to south west during the storms. Since the end of precipitation winds have lightened and shifted to the north and freezing levels have dropped to below 1000m.</p>
<p><strong>Avalanche Summary :</strong></p>
<p><span>Widespread small loose wet avalanches were observed at tree line and below with the warming and rain on Saturday.</span><br /><br /><span>Explosives triggered avalanches large enough to bury, injure or kill a person were observed on Saturday morning.</span><br /><br /><span>We suspect that a more widespread natural avalanche cycle occurred in the alpine during storms over the weekend but limited visibility have resulted in no observations of this to time of writing.</span></p>
<p><strong>Snowpack &nbsp;Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The height of snow at tree line likely ranges from 50cm to over a metre depending on location on the island (least on the north island). At tree line and below a rain crust of about 3mm thickness sits on top. Below this the storm snow of the last week increases only slightly in density towards the ground. Storm shears exist within the mid snowpack. These delivered easy to moderate test results with resistant planar character on Sunday. 3cm or so of moist melt-freeze snow is found on the ground. We have no observations from above tree line on the island as yet but can extrapolate from weather and field data from tree line that snow depths are greater in the alpine and that storm shears are slower in tightening and will produce easier results for longer. Also wind slab will be more widespread and will remain reactive to loads for longer in the alpine.</p>
<p><strong>Weather Forecast:</strong></p>
