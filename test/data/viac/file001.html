<p class="Body"><strong>Confidence: </strong>Fair to Good. Confidence in the weather predictions is quite good though there is some uncertainty about exact precipitation amounts and freezing levels.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p class="Body"><strong></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Main Concerns:</strong> (Avalanche problems)</span></p>
<p><strong>Wind Slab</strong> - New wind slabs have formed and continue to form on NW through to NE aspects, and in cross loaded features at tree line and in the alpine. When the wind shifts on Saturday new slabs will be formed on S to E aspects. These wind slabs will likely 
fail naturally and be easily triggerable by
 humans and will produce avalanches from small to big enough to bury, 
injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Storm Slab - </strong>Significant amounts of new snow are making for unstable new snow on all aspects 
and at all elevations. These storm slabs will likely fail naturally and 
be easily triggerable by humans and will produce avalanches from small 
to big enough to bury, injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Slab -</strong>&nbsp; Significant&nbsp; load from new snow will be 
loading weak layers buried in the snow pack found on shady (NE to NW) aspects at 
all elevations. These vary 
from buried surface hoar found in shady areas sheltered from wind at 
tree line and below, to buried surface facets and weak crusts on shady 
aspects in the alpine. While these weaknesses are now more difficult to 
trigger than they were last week end (see incident reports) it is still 
possible for a larger trigger, such as an avalanche in storm layers "stepping down", a cornice fall or perhaps even a heavier human load such as a 
snow mobile, to activate these layers and cause avalanches larger than what is required to bury injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong></p>
<p>From early Wednesday until early Friday the island mountains had received between 15 and 50cm of new snow (highest amounts on the west coast, medium on the north island and least on the east coast). The freezing level climbed on a couple of occasions bringing the rain line up to about 1200m with light rain to that elevation on Wednesday and heavier rain on Friday morning on parts of the island. Winds were strong enough to move snow and came from SW to SE during the precipitation. The outlook is as 
follows:</p>
<p><strong>Friday: </strong>Precipitation continuing bringing 35 to 55cm of additional snow. Freezing levels climbing to between 1000 and 1300m. Winds moderate to strong SW to SE.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong> Light snow (3-5cm) except perhaps locally heavier over the north island (up to 20cm). Freezing level 600-800m. Winds moderate to strong NW.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong>: A trace of snow still possible in some areas but generally clearing skies. Freezing level between surface and 400m. Winds light N and NE.</p>
<p><strong>Snow Pack:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">15 to 50cm of new snow sits on a variety of surfaces from crusts of varying thicknesses below tree line and at tree line to previous storm snow in the alpine. </span>Wind slabs have been formed in the alpine and at tree line by winds from the south east through west to north west.<span style="font-size: small;">
 At various depths (depending on snow pack depths on different parts of 
the island as well as specific location with relation to wind loading) 
crusts with facets and surface hoar sitting on them exist on shady 
aspects. These layers were the failure plane of numerous natural and 
skier triggered avalanches across the island last week end. At tree line 
and below with the snow having become warm and then cooled again, these 
layers will be very difficult to trigger but we expect that a larger 
trigger (</span>an avalanche in storm layers "stepping down", a cornice fall or perhaps even a heavier human load such as a 
snow mobile)<span style="font-size: small;"> could still activate them even at these elevations. In the alpine 
these layers could be more reactive. The lower snowpack is strong and
 well consolidated.<br /></span></p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Avalanche Activity:</strong></p>
<p class="Body">No new activity has yet been reported by time of writing (Friday morning) though we expect that a natural avalanche cycle is under way.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Advisory:</strong></p>
<p>Stay out of avalanche terrain on Friday. Stick to lower angled and well forested "Simple" terrain if you want to stay out of trouble. As the storm lets up remain aware that instabilities in new snow and new wind slabs will take several days to settle out and stabilize. On Saturday and Sunday avoid area of loading from wind including ridge tops, cross loaded features and gullies and note that the winds are shifting on Saturday to newly load slopes facing S to E, Cracks, shooting cracks, whumpfing sounds and avalanche activity in the last 48 hours are all strong indications of instability in the snow pack. Be aware that persistent 
instabilities buried deeper in the snowpack may be triggerable by 
heavy loads (which could include smaller avalanches "stepping own") and could produce larger avalanches with greater consequences.</p>

<p class="Body"><strong>Confidence: </strong>Fair. Timing and intensity of the system coming Thursday are uncertain<strong>. </strong>Hazard ratings above for Thursday are based on the assumption that the storm does not start until the evening.

<p class="Body"><strong></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Main Concerns:</strong> (Avalanche problems)</span></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Wind Slab</strong> - New wind slabs have been formed in the alpine by winds from the south east through west to north west. With the system coming Thursday/Friday much more new snow and wind will form deeper winds slabs at tree line and in the alpine on all the same aspects as winds will come first from the south east to south west and later from the north west. These wind slabs will likely fail naturally or be easily triggerable by
 humans and will produce avalanches from small to big enough to bury, 
injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Storm Slab - </strong>Significant amounts of new snow with our<strong> </strong>next system Thursday/Friday will make for unstable new snow on all aspects and at all elevations. These storm slabs will likely fail naturally or be easily triggerable by humans and will produce avalanches from small to big enough to bury, injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Slab -</strong>&nbsp; New snow will be

<p><strong>Weather:</strong></p>
<p>The Island Alps received between 5 and 30mm of precipitation since Monday 
(up to 30mm north and central island, 20mm west island and 5-10mm east island). Freezing levels went up to around tree line 
around mid day to mid afternoon on Tuesday. Winds with this system were
moderate to strong from the south east through west to north west.&nbsp;
 The outlook is as 
follows:</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday: </strong>Light snow fall (0-5cm). Moderate to strong winds from the north west. Freezing level 500-1000m.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> 10-20cm of snow starting late in the day. Moderate to strong winds from the south east to south west. Freezing level 500-1000m.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong>: The system from overnight Thursday continues bringing another 25-40cm of snow. Southerly winds lighten but then turn to the north west and rise again to moderate to strong. Freezing level 500-800m.</p>
<p><strong>Snow Pack:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Up to tree line the snow surface became moist on Tuesday and then froze again overnight, whereas in the alpine all our new precipitation this week has come as snow. </span>New wind slabs have been formed in the alpine by winds from the south east through west to north west.<span style="font-size: small;"> At various depths (depending on snow pack depths on different parts of the island as well as specific location with relation to wind loading) crusts with facets and surface hoar sitting on them exist on shady aspects.

<p class="Body"><strong>Avalanche Activity:</strong></p>
<p class="Body">Only loose snow avalanches below tree line on steep, sunny terrain have been reported with the warming on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Advisory:</strong></p>
<p>Avoid avalanche terrain in times of significant loading from new snow and wind (Friday). Watch the approach of the next system on Thursday and be aware that the hazard ratings above are based on the assumption that the system does not reach us until Thursday evening. If it comes earlier raise the hazard. Avoid newly wind loaded areas at ridge tops, in cross loaded features and in gullies. Give cornices a wide berth whether traveling above or below them. Be aware the persistent instabilities buried deeper in the snowpack may be triggerable by heavier loads such as a cornice fall or perhaps even a snowmobile.</p>

<p class="Body"><strong>Confidence: </strong>Fair. Timing of the system coming in Tuesday is uncertain as are freezing levels with that system.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p class="Body"><strong></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Main Concerns:</strong> (Avalanche problems)</span></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Wind Slab</strong> - New wind slabs were formed on NE through to NW aspects in the alpine and at tree line with our system on Friday/Saturday. These were easily triggerable by humans on Saturday (see incident reports) and were failing naturally.&nbsp; These slabs will continue to be triggerable by 
humans in the alpine on Monday. More new winds slab will be created by Tuesdays system if freezing levels stay low enough for the precipitation to come as snow rather than as rain. Watch freezing levels and assume that were it snows there will be wind slab on east aspects from strong westerly winds. These wind slabs will produce avalanches from small to big enough to bury injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Storm Slab - </strong>Precipitation forecast for Tuesday/Wednesday will warm as it falls making for an "upside down" situation in the snow and weaknesses within the storm snow. The loading from new snow and/or rain may also trigger wind slabs from this past week end mentioned above.<strong> </strong>These storm slabs will produce avalanches from small to big enough to bury injure or kill a person.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Slab -</strong>&nbsp; New snow and/or rain will be 
loading weak layers in the 
upper snow pack found on shady aspects at all elevations. These vary from buried surface hoar found in shady areas sheltered from wind at tree line and below to buried surface facets and weak crusts on shady aspects in the alpine.</p>
<p><strong>Weather:</strong></p>
<p>The Island Alps received between 20 and 50cm of snow since Friday (50cm west island, 35 cm east island, 20cm north island). Nearly all of this fell on Friday/Saturday. Freezing levels spiked up to tree line around mid day to mid afternoon on Saturday. Winds with this system were strong enough to move snow and came from the south east to south west.&nbsp; The outlook is as 
follows:</p>
<p><strong>Monday: </strong>Light snow fall (3-7cm). Light to moderate winds with variable direction. Freezing level around 800m.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> 20-35mm of water to come as rain or snow depending on elevation and what the freezing levels decide to do. They'll likely go at least to tree line but may go right over the tops of the island alps. Winds strong to very strong from the west.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong>: The system tapers off with lighter precipitation (around 10cm of snow). Freezing levels dropping down to around 700m. Strong winds from the west and north west.</p>
<p><strong>Snow Pack:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">20-50cm of new snow from Friday/Saturday was moved by moderate winds from the south east to south west to form wind slabs that were easily triggerable by people on Saturday. With freezing levels rising during the storm this snow was "upside down" with wetter more dense snow sitting on drier, lower density snow. This density change was the failure plane in one skier triggered avalanche on Saturday and delivered moderate test results on Sunday. This storm snow sits on 10 to 
15cm of previous storm snow from last week which also came in upside down and also formed wind slabs at tree line and above. All of this in turn sits on facets and surface hoar sitting on a crust on shady and 
sheltered aspects at tree line and below. These layers were still delivering easy test results on Sunday. In the
 Alpine new and previous wind slabs sit on
top of a 
weak crust which also has facets at it. The lower snowpack is strong and well consolidated.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">East 
Island snow packs average about 2.7 m at tree line, west Island 
snowpack about 3.8 m and north Island snow pack is about 2 m.<br /></span></p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Avalanche Activity:</strong></p>
<p class="Body">Five reported avalanches accidentally triggered by skiers to size 2 (big enough to bury injure or kill a person) on Saturday. Natural slab and loose snow avalanches to size 1.5 Saturday. Reports of natural and human triggered activity from the the south to the north end of the island alps.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Advisory:</strong></p>
<p>Avoid areas of wind loading near ridge tops and in cross loaded features and gullies in the alpine on Monday and early Tuesday and be aware that there are still pockets of triggerable snow at tree line and below as well. Avoid avalanche terrain at times of new loading as will occur on Tuesday/Wednesday. Keep your eye on freezing levels with the storm Tuesday/ Wednesday and be aware that where the precipitation comes as snow it can be moved by wind to increase load many fold and to form wind slabs. Avoid areas of new loading by wind at that time.</p>
