The avalanche danger is <span style="color: #ff6600;">CONSIDERABLE</span> on all other terrain in our advisory area.</p>
<p>Good Morning! This is Tim Laroche with the West Central Montana Avalanche Center’s backcountry avalanche advisory for Friday, January 11th, 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Weather and Snowpack Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Scattered snowfall has continued overnight and this week’s storm has left 12 to 21 inches of new snow in the mountains of west central Montana. The winds blew steadily from 10-20mph yesterday mainly from the north and west. Temperatures continue to drop. Currently it is snowing lightly, winds are generally light out of the north and west, and temperatures are hovering in the single digits in most locations.</p>
<p>The old snow surface from last week’s dry weather that is now buried 1-2 feet deep has indeed created a fragile <span class="domtooltips">weak layer<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A snowpack layer with less strength than adjacent layers.

The secondary avalanche concern is storm <span class="domtooltips">slabs<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer. A layer of snow stronger than underlying layers.</span></span> that are also resting on the weak faceted layer of snow in areas that have not been affected by the wind. Stay off and out from underneath steep terrain until the new snow has had time to settle and stabilize. This will not happen quickly with the widespread and persistent <span class="domtooltips">weak layer<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A snowpack layer with less strength than adjacent layers. Often the layer in the snowpack where an avalanche fractures.</span></span> we are now dealing with. The bright side is that we have a very strong and supportive snowpack below the new storm snow.</p>
<p>Our latest storm started with warm temperatures that have now cooled significantly. The snow has continued to fall and the primary riding surface is now very low <span class="domtooltips">density<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The mass of snow per unit volume, but often expressed as a percent water content. New fallen powder has a <span class="domtooltips">low density<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The mass of snow per unit volume, but often expressed as a percent water content.

This condition allows for excellent riding opportunities on low angle terrain. Be conservative in your decision making and don’t let the lure of deep powder dreams lull you into riding on a steep, unstable slope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Weather Forecast and Avalanche Outlook</strong></p>
<p>Today expect light snow to continue with the chance of another 1-3 inches of accumulation before the storm finally exits to the east tonight. Winds should be in the 5-10 mph range mainly out of the north and temperatures will remain cold with highs in the low teens and lows in the single digits.</p>
<p>I expect the avalanche danger to slowly decrease over time, but the cold weather will continue to maintain the weak faceted layer that is our primary concern.</p>
<p>Dudley will issue the next advisory on Tuesday, January 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Make plans now to join us on Wednesday, January 16<sup>th</sup> for Community Unite Pint Night at the Northside Kettle House. Proceeds help to benefit the West Central Montana Avalanche Foundation. 6-9pm</p>

<p>Good Morning! This is Tim Laroche with the West Central Montana Avalanche Center&#8217;s backcountry avalanche advisory for Tuesday, January 8th, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Weather and Snowpack Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The storm that rolled in yesterday left 3-9 inches(.4-1.3” <a href="http://www.or.nrcs.usda.gov/Snow/about/swe.html">SWE</a>) of new snow and produced winds in the 15-20mph range out of the southwest. The southern Mission and Swan ranges received the higher amounts of snowfall with the southern Bitterroots receiving the lesser amounts. Currently mountain temperatures are in the high 20’s, winds are blowing steadily from 10-20mph out of the southwest, and bands of snow are tracking through our forecast area.<span id="more-2864"></span></p>
<p>We have been enjoying some fantastic snow days in the mountains this past week on a mostly stable snowpack(<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/112238525731338413634/20122013SnowProfiles#5830905216723983154">profile</a>). Now the weather is changing and we are headed into another welcomed storm cycle.

Pay attention to obvious clues of instability like recent avalanche activity, periods of intense precipitation, strong winds transporting snow, or the feel of a &#8220;slabby&#8221; snowpack. Move off and out from under steep terrain until the storm snow has had time to settle.</p>
<p><strong>Weather Forecast and Avalanche Outlook</strong></p>
<p>Today a moist and warm weather system is set to impact our advisory area. Forecasts are calling for 1-3 inches of new snow today and another 2-5 inches tonight with continued precipitation through Thursday. Temperatures will be in the low to mid thirties, winds will be out of the southwest between 15 and 20mph and snow levels around 5000’.</p>
<p>Continued precipitation, warm temperatures, and strong winds will cause the avalanche danger to increase over the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>I will issue the next advisory on Friday, January 11<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>If you get out and have the time to send us some information about what you are seeing, please use our “public observations” link on our website or send us a quick note at info@missoulaavalanche.org. Thank you for your continued support!</p>

<p>Good morning. This Dudley Improta with the West Central Montana Avalanche Center’s advisory for January 4, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Weather and Snowpack Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Drier air and high pressure did indeed enter our region for the New Year. Temperatures at higher elevations have been quite warm during the daylight hours for the past few days. The weather did settle the snowpack and it is fairly evident from the numbers of skiers and riders recreating on steep terrain that the avalanche danger is <strong>LOW</strong> for now.</p>
<p>Yesterday we received observations from the southern Missions, southern Swans, Rattlesnakes, South Fork of Lolo Creek, Hoodoo Pass, Lookout Pass and Lost Trail Pass. All reports indicate a very stable snowpack. Loose snow sluffs were noted on very steep slopes and there is the slight possibility of triggering a wind <span class="domtooltips"><span class="domtooltips">slab<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer.

<p>Many of us are enjoying the recent conditions and riding and skiing steep lines. Don’t be lulled into complacency when conditions change this winter.</p>
<p><span id="more-2847"></span></p>
<p><strong>Weather Forecast and Avalanche Outlook</strong></p>
<p>The recent weather has promoted <span class="domtooltips">surface hoar<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Feathery crystals that form on the snow surface during clear and calm conditions - essentially <span class="domtooltips">frozen dew<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Feathery crystals that form on the snow surface during clear and calm conditions - essentially frozen dew.

We all want more snow; we should all pay attention to how much new snow we get and how it bonds (or doesn’t bond) to current surfaces.</p>
<p>Today a weak disturbance is expected to increase clouds and possibly produce light snow. A brief high pressure builds into the region tonight and Saturday, but should begin to break down on Sunday. Next week expect unsettled weather and moderate snowfall.</p>
<p><strong>Lift-Served Backcountry Skiing</strong></p>
<p>Avalanche specialists and ski area managers have decided they don’t like the term sidecounty. They feel the term may conjure up a notion of safety beyond the ski area boundaries. Sidecountry, slackcountry; remember when it was called “ducking the ropes”? Some skis are now promoted as perfect for slicing up the off –piste powder and then carving turns on the groomers back to the lifts. Either way you cut it, using the lifts to gain access to uncontrolled terrain is as popular as fly-fishing in Montana.</p>
<p>Here’s a few thoughts why lift –served backcountry skiing may be more inherently dangerous than straight-up backcountry skiing:</p>
<ol>
<li>You’re approaching the terrain from the top. You may not gather clues as if you were climbing from a trailhead; i.e. whoomphing, collapses, recent activity, etc.</li>
<li>There may be a false sense of security because of the proximity of the ski area and the patrol (if buried in an avalanche you may have 15 minutes, maybe).</li>
<li>You may not be as adequately prepared as you would be if leaving from a trailhead. You may not have that full pack if you “duck the rope” looking for that quick fresh line.</li>
<li>The possibility of others skiing and riding down on top of you is greater.</li>
</ol>

<p>Happy New Year! This Dudley Improta with the West Central Montana Avalanche Center’s advisory for January 1, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Weather and Snowpack Analysis</strong></p>
<p>We experienced the “arctic fluff” we hear about in Utah. But, we got a few inches; not a couple of feet. The last few days it turned cold and the forecast area received an inch or two here, and an inch or two there, of very cold, light snow. That snowfall coupled with some surface <span class="domtooltips">faceting<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Angular snow with poor bonding created from large temperature gradients within the snowpack.</span></span> has led to some light fluffy stuff on top; 6 to 14 inches, depending on where you’re riding.</p>
<p>The cold temperatures, however, have allowed our wind-<span class="domtooltips"><span class="domtooltips">slab<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer. A layer of snow stronger than underlying layers.</span></span><span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer.

Friday, skiers triggered a wind-<span class="domtooltips"><span class="domtooltips">slab<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer. A layer of snow stronger than underlying layers.</span></span><span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer. A layer of snow stronger than underlying layers.</span></span> with a 12 to 14 inch crown on a steep north slope in the Rattlesnakes. While touring near Lost Trail Pass on Sunday one of our observers, Rich Raines, had some <span class="domtooltips">collapsing<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Whumpf has actually been adopted as a technical avalanche term to describe the sound of a collapsing snowpack when you cross the snow. A sign of instability.

A layer of snow stronger than underlying layers.</span></span><span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer.

Same as avalanche.</span></span> on a very steep southeast slope. Yesterday, an observation from Wisherd Ridge near Missoula reported a very weak Rutschblock score (the block slid while being cut) involving the top 18 inches of the snowpack on an eastern <span class="domtooltips">aspect<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The compass direction a slope faces i.e. North, South, East, West.</span></span>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2830"></span></p>
<p>This tells you, while things are generally stable and folks are riding and skiing steep lines, we have potential avalanche problems in specific terrain features. The way to figure out if there is a problem is to take a bit of time, dig a <span class="domtooltips">snowpit<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A pit dug vertically into the snowpack where snow layering is observed and stability tests may be performed. Also called a snow profile.</span></span> and check things out. You may not be seeing or hearing the obvious clues (i.e. whoomphing, <span class="domtooltips">collapsing<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Whumpf has actually been adopted as a technical avalanche term to describe the sound of a collapsing snowpack when you cross the snow. A sign of instability.
</span></span>, recent activity) and a simple snow test might reveal a weakness in the snow.</p>
<p>A secondary problem is the cold surface snow is readily sluffing on steep slopes (35 degrees and steeper). Not a big problem if you have some <span class="domtooltips">sluff<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A <span class="domtooltips">Loose Snow Avalanche<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A Loose Snow Avalanche or Sluff.</span></span> or Sluff.</span></span> management skills; but if you are in terrain where a sizeable <span class="domtooltips">sluff<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A <span class="domtooltips">Loose Snow Avalanche<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A Loose Snow Avalanche or Sluff.</span></span> or Sluff.</span></span> could carry you into trees, rocks, or over a cliff it could be a bad situation. There are areas in the Rattlesnakes where the light snow is sitting on top of stiff, wind-hardened snow. In these places the new snow sluffs easily.</p>
<p><strong>Weather Forecast and Avalanche Outlook</strong></p>
<p>Drier air is expected to move in this evening as high pressure builds into the region. This will set the stage for <span class="domtooltips">surface hoar<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Feathery crystals that form on the snow surface during clear and calm conditions - essentially <span class="domtooltips">frozen dew<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Feathery crystals that form on the snow surface during clear and calm conditions - essentially frozen dew.

This is not a problem now; but possibly could be a weakness in the snowpack when we get more snow. For now, milder air temperatures are predicted for the upper elevations. If these temperatures occur, it should settle the existing snowpack.</p>

<h3><strong>Weather and Snowpack Analysis</strong></h3>
<p>Since Christmas day, area SNOTEL sites have picked up little snow but the wind continues moving snow at the highest elevations.  Thursday winds were from the southwest at a steady 15-17 mph.  Visibility was poor and the wind was moving snow onto <span class="domtooltips">leeward<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Wind erodes snow from the windward (upwind) side of an obstacle and deposits snow on the leeward (downwind) side.

The primary concern for now will be the steeper terrain that has been recently <span class="domtooltips">wind loaded<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The added weight of wind drifted snow.</span></span>. The layers at mid-pack may react to a big shock on <span class="domtooltips">wind loaded<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The added weight of wind drifted snow.</span></span> terrain or steep slope rollovers.  The northern Bitterroot has been receiving more snow than other locations but the snow structure is similar with <span class="domtooltips">wind loaded<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The added weight of wind drifted snow.</span></span> slopes steeper than 35 degrees being the primary concern.  It is still possible to <span class="domtooltips"><span class="domtooltips">trigger<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A disturbance that initiates fracture  within the weak layer causing an avalanche .

<h3><strong>Weather Forecast and Avalanche Outlook</strong></h3>
<p>The Missoula Office of the National Weather Service is forecasting a series of minor disturbances to roll through the northern Rockies during the next few days. Very little precipitation is expected with these systems.  A warmer and dryer scenario is expected to build next week which will continue to strengthen our mountain snowpack.  It may also lead to the formation of <span class="domtooltips">surface hoar<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Feathery crystals that form on the snow surface during clear and calm conditions - essentially <span class="domtooltips">frozen dew<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Feathery crystals that form on the snow surface during clear and calm conditions - essentially frozen dew.

<p>The avalanche danger is expected to remain similar with <span class="domtooltips">wind loaded<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The added weight of wind drifted snow.</span></span> terrain steeper than 35 degrees having the most potential to avalanche.</p>
<p>Last February, an avalanche just outside the Stevens Pass Ski Area claimed the lives of 3 people.  This happened in an area easily accessed from the ski area.  The New York Times recently published an account of the accident with details about the decision making of a large group of skiers and snowboarders who left the ski area to enjoy fresh powder in the backcountry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/?src=me&amp;ref=general#/?part=tunnel-creek" target="_blank">Snow Fall: The Avalanche at Tunnel Creek</a>.</p>
<p>This is a good reminder that when you leave the ski area boundary you are now in a backcountry setting and in many cases, in avalanche terrain.  This is certainly the case at many of the ski areas in western Montana. If you leave the ski area, you need to be prepared. That means having knowledge of avalanche terrain, the ability to make good decisions, having rescue gear like a transceiver, <span class="domtooltips">probe<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A metal rod used to probe through avalanche debris for buried victims.</span></span> and shovel and understanding that you may be own your own for a long time if something goes sideways.  Even a minor injury or equipment failure can have life-threatening consequences.</p>
<p>We hope Santa left some rescue gear under the tree for you. If so, or if you want to get proficient with your transceiver, visit one of our BCA Beacon Basin transceiver training parks.</p>
<p>The Lolo Pass Beacon Basin is available 7 days a week and is located next to the Lolo Pass Visitor Center.  This park does not require you to check anything out, just go to the control box, read the directions and you are good to go.  We also have similar parks at the top of Montana Snowbowl and Lost Trail Ski Areas. You must have a lift ticket to access these parks.</p>
<p>Dudley Improta will issue the next advisory on New Years Day.  Have a safe holiday!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast and Avalanche Outlook</h3>
<p>Temperatures this morning are in the teens and low twenties and we received another dusting of snow overnight.  The Missoula Office of the National Weather Service is forecasting a ridge of high pressure to build today with another system expected to move into the northern Rockies late tonight. The area south of the I-90 corridor has the best chance for snow with the heaviest amounts falling along the ID-MT border.  After Thursday, weather models are leaning toward high pressure building which could give us an extended dry period.</p>
<p>The avalanche danger is expected to remain similar throughout the next few days. If any location receives more than 6 inches of snow, expect to see it easily slough off 35 degree and steeper slopes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Leaving the Ski Area Boundary</strong></p>
<p>Last February, an avalanche just outside the Stevens Pass Ski Area claimed the lives of 3 people.  This happened in an area easily accessed from the ski area.  The New York Times recently published an account of the accident with details about the decision making of a large group of skiers and snowboarders who left the ski area to enjoy fresh powder in the backcountry.</p>

<p>Good Mayan morning! This Dudley Improta with the West Central Montana Avalanche Center’s advisory for December 21, 2012.<span id="more-2705"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Weather and Snowpack Analysis</strong></p>
<p>During this last week the advisory area received decent amounts of snow. Over the last few days storms dumped up to 15-20 inches along the Idaho border near Lookout pass to Lolo Pass. The Rattlesnakes, southern Missions and southern Swans received about 10-15 inches of new snow. The most recent event from the last 48 hours appears to have skirted the southern end of the area.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong><em>Although our overall rating is <span style="color: #bfc605; text-decoration: underline;">MODERATE</span>; potentially triggered avalanches will be larger in the Lookout / Hoodoo region because that area received more snow.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>The last storm came in with high winds across the area. All observers mentioned wind-scouring and wind deposits. Our main problem is <span class="domtooltips"><span class="domtooltips">wind <span class="domtooltips">slabs<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer.

<p>A secondary problem is weakness in the top part of the snowpack. That weakness may be 10 inches from the surface (Southern Missions, Rattlesnakes) to 24 inches from the surface (Lookout Pass, Hoodoo Pass). Generally, these <span class="domtooltips">weaknesses<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A snowpack layer with less strength than adjacent layers.

A layer of snow stronger than underlying layers.</span></span> on Southwest slopes while ski-cutting.</p>
<p>At Lolo Pass the observers noted an overall strong snowpack below 7000 feet but were concerned about the aforementioned wind-<span class="domtooltips">loading<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The addition of weight on top of a snowpack, usually from precipitation, wind drifting, or a person.</span></span>. Observer Dave Williams provided this video from Lolo: <a href=" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHmHs2zWyM">ECT Lolo Pass Dec. 12, 2012</a> .</p>
<p>There is some good riding and skiing to be found out there for sure; but steep slopes should be suspect and approached cautiously. Take time to check out the snowpack carefully if you&#8217;re considering recreating on steep terrain.</p>
<p>On the bright side; snotel sites in the area indicate the snow is settling rapidly, a sign of a stabilizing snowpack.</p>
<p>You can view current season <span class="domtooltips">snowpit<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A pit dug vertically into the snowpack where snow layering is observed and stability tests may be performed.

<p><strong>Weather Forecast and Avalanche Outlook</strong></p>
<p>A southwesterly flow has resumed and will persist through Saturday producing snow showers. A weak disturbance Saturday night may enhance snowfall. A cold arctic air mass is predicted to move in and produce lower temperatures on Sunday.</p>
<p>With cooling temperatures and some additional amounts of snow I would expect the avalanche danger to remain at <span style="color: #bfc605;">MODERATE</span>. <span class="domtooltips"><span class="domtooltips">Wind <span class="domtooltips">slabs<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer.

<p>Happy Holidays! If you head into the backcountry this weekend, <strong>ski and ride safe!</strong></p>
<p>Steve (Santa Claus) Karkanen will issue the next advisory Tuesday, Christmas Morning, 2012.</p>
<p>As we enter into another skiing &amp; riding season, I would like to extend thanks to folks who post public observations or sent us reports and information. Quite a few people in the area get out a lot and we have a large forecast area; it helps to hear if we missed something or get a confirmation of the advisory. I believe everyone who uses the advisory appreciates your contributions.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mostly stable conditions and excellent skiing and riding now prevail in the mountains of west central Montana. Hello!  This is Steve Karkanen at the West Central Montana Avalanche Center with the avalanche advisory for Friday December 14, 2012.  We are rating the avalanche danger for elevations above 6000&#8242; at <span style="color: #f8f806;"><strong>MODERATE</strong></span> on <span class="domtooltips">wind loaded<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The added weight of wind drifted snow.</span></span> terrain steeper than 35 degrees and <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>LOW</strong></span> everywhere else.</p>
<p><strong>Weather and Snowpack Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Since last Saturday most mountain locations picked up several inches of new snow with high wind redistributing much of it on Sunday and Monday.  8000&#8242; winds Sunday were a brutal 20-30 mph with temperatures in the teens.</p>
<p>Although our regular observer group does not begin field work until next Thursday, we have received several good reports from a variety of locations in the Bitterroot, the southern Swans and the Rattlesnake the past few days. All indicate similar conditions with thin snow up to 6000&#8242; and very good snow with a solid base above 6000&#8242;.  The primary avalanche problem early in the week was at the highest elevations on steep, <span class="domtooltips">leeward<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">Wind erodes snow from the windward (upwind) side of an obstacle and deposits snow on the leeward (downwind) side.

<p>Since then, wind and snow tapered off giving the most affected areas a chance to settle.  Our <span class="domtooltips">stability<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The chance that an avalanche will not occur, relative to a given trigger (usually the weight of a human).</span></span> testing tells us our primary avalanche problem will be <span class="domtooltips"><span class="domtooltips">wind <span class="domtooltips">slabs<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer.

<p><strong>Weather Forecast and Avalanche Outlook</strong></p>
<p>The Missoula Office of the National Weather Service is forecasting 3 weather systems to move through the northern Rockies this weekend.  The first arrives Friday with minimal precipitation.  The second storm moves in Saturday night into Sunday with snow focused over the Clearwater Mountains to the west. There is increasing confidence that the third storm will carry a lot of snow and wind into the area Monday and Tuesday.  Snowfall accumulation will be widespread and gusty SW winds will develop Monday.  The airmass is expected to warm and will contain more moisture which translates into a more dense snowfall than the area experienced last week.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the teens and twenties are keeping the newest snow light and dry so expect snow <span class="domtooltips">stability<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The chance that an avalanche will not occur, relative to a given trigger (usually the weight of a human).</span></span> conditions to worsen if this forecast comes to fruition with heavy dense snow.

<p>Recent weather dumped abundant snow in the  west central Montana mountains.  SNOTEL sites above 7000 feet report an average of 48&#8243; with Hoodoo showing 59&#8243;, Saddle Mountain 51&#8243;, Stuart Pk. 45&#8243; and Lolo and Lookout passes at 32&#8243; each.  This newest snow came in moist which results in most mountain locations above 6500 feet starting out with a solid base and no faceted <span class="domtooltips"><span class="domtooltips">weak layers<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A snowpack layer with less strength than adjacent layers.

<p>We&#8217;ve received many good reports from the Hoodoo Pass area this week.  The avalanche specialists toured into the Rattlesnake Wilderness Friday after setting up the Beacon Park at the top of Montana Snowbowl.</p>
<p>We found a mostly stable snowpack that skied well for the first week of December.  There are some considerations that need to find their way into your decision making if you plan to leave ski area boundaries or ride a heavy sled on steep open terrain.</p>
<p>All the pits and <span class="domtooltips">stability<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The chance that an avalanche will not occur, relative to a given trigger (usually the weight of a human).</span></span> tests indicate mostly stable snow but we did experience minor sluffing on the steepest slope angles involving the new storm snow. These sluffs will be bigger today after last nights heavy snow. Another consideration is that in some areas the snow of the past week or two has not had time to strongly bond to the old early season snow that was exposed to warm temperatures and rain in many locations.  On an east <span class="domtooltips">aspect<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The compass direction a slope faces i.e. North, South, East, West.</span></span> at 7700 feet I was able to get a 25&#8243; <span class="domtooltips"><span class="domtooltips">slab<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A relatively cohesive snowpack layer.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This alone should make you want to think pretty hard about how steep and how big a line you want to ride.  The good thing about this is that most areas don&#8217;t yet have enough snow to cover terrain features and vegetation that anchor snow to steep slopes. If you are unsure about a slopes <span class="domtooltips">stability<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">The chance that an avalanche will not occur, relative to a given trigger (usually the weight of a human).</span></span>, dig a quick pit or find less steep or exposed terrain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Early Season Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Now that the ski areas are open and conditions are good for backcountry travel, please keep your safety and the safety of others you may encounter in the backcountry.  More people are leaving ski area boundaries for fresh tracks many of whom clueless to the danger they present to themselves, other parties or their rescuers.  Side-country is backcountry. No exceptions!  You must be prepared to deal with avalanche conditions, survival and rescue on your own.</p>
<p>Always carry an avalanche transceiver, <span class="domtooltips">probe<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A metal rod used to probe through avalanche debris for buried victims.</span></span> pole and shovel. Go with partners that you know and can deal with an emergency and if you ski or ride on slopes steep enough to <span class="domtooltips">slide<span class="domtooltips_tooltip" style="display: none">A mass of snow sliding, tumbling, or flowing down an inclined surface. Same as avalanche.</span></span>, do it one at a time.</p>
<p>We begin the regular Friday/Tuesday advisory program December 21 and will post updates as conditions change.  We are not issuing avalanche danger ratings until we start getting consistent data from our partners and observers in the Bitterroot Mountains and near Seeley Lake.</p>
