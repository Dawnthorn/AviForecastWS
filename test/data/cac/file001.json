Buried wind slabs are found on all aspects in the Alpine and just down into Treeline elevations, but they are variable in nature. These slabs are 5 to 20cm thick and sit on a pronounced layer of weak facets just above the Nov 12th crust layer which is now buried between 40 and 60cm. Recent snowpack stability tests are giving widely variable results below these buried wind slabs.</span></p>","weatherForecast":"<p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_AA239A9B\">Monday will bring cold and clear conditions with highs near -20 Â°C and significant wind chill values.
